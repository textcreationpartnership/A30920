            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>THE Author of theſe <hi>Sermons</hi> was a Perſon of great Learning and Piety, both which he did abundantly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, whileſt he was for ſeverall years Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of <hi>Catherine Hall</hi> in the <hi>Univerſity</hi> of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he was reputed to be one of the moſt un-wearied Diligence, profound Learning, and Exemplary Piety and Charity of his Time.</p>
            <p>No leſs eſteem had he amongſt the Clergy and all that knew him, after he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the <hi>Univerſity</hi> to the Rectory of <hi>Danby-Wisk</hi> nigh <hi>North-Allerton</hi> in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> in the Year 1659. Where he continued in ſuch a retired ſtation, as his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59183:3"/> Humility and Contentedneſs of Mind most affected, for almost twenty five Years, till his last Sickneſs, which happened in the beginning of the Year 1684. During his continuance in this place he always made it his buſineſs, and the Employment of his whole time to promote the Eternall happineſs of all under his care and charge, by a conſtant and diligent performance of all thoſe Duties that a Miniſter owes to his Pariſhioners. And not Regarding either the ſmallneſs of his Pariſh, or his own eaſe, he Preached continually twice every Lords day; and beſides that, he took all other op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of Faſts and Holy-days, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the People their Duties upon thoſe Occaſions.</p>
            <p>There he Preached all the following <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> Except only the Fourth, which he Compoſed upon an Extraordinary occaſion, as the Title of it ſhews.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59183:3"/>
            <p>In theſe and all his <hi>Sermons</hi> he affected ſuch a plainneſs of Style, &amp; Familiarity of Expreſſion as was most ſuitable to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities of his Pariſhioners. And it is to be hoped, that this plainneſs of his will not be accounted a fault by the Candid Reader, who ſhall conſider that the main end and deſign of all the <hi>Authors</hi> Labours, was not to pleaſe the Ears of his Auditors with fine Phraſes, and exact Expreſſions, but fully to Inſtruct them in the Knowledge, and Affectionately to excite them to the Practice of the great Duties of the Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian Religion. For both which he was Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently qualified by his great Learning and Skill in all parts of Divinity, and by that hearty deſire, and ardent Zeal for the welfare and ſalvation of all Mankind, which was the first Principle of all his actions.</p>
            <p>And as it was the only buſineſs of this <hi>Authors</hi> whole Life, to do good by his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59183:4"/> and Example, ſo it is the ſame ſincere Principle that has influenced the Publiſhers of this work, and induced them to expoſe theſe diſcourſes to the World; that ſo the benefits of them might be more Generall, and no longer be confined to thoſe few Relations, that underſtood his way of Writing: And it will be a ſufficient Satisfaction to them, if thoſe great Ends, which the <hi>AUTHOR</hi> aimed at in his Preaching, be in any meaſure attained by the Publiſhing of theſe his <hi>Poſthumous Sermons.</hi> If the amendment of Mens Lives and Manners be the happy effect of their Reading, what is here hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſigned, and humbly recommended for that Purpoſe.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>
                  <hi>St.</hi> Matthew, 5. 48.</bibl>
               <q>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven is perfect.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN theſe words you have two things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable; their dependance, and their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. As for their dependance, and cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, its evident from the particle <hi>Therefore,</hi> that they are a concluſion drawn from ſomewhat premiſed, what ever that be, <hi>q. d.</hi> ſeeing all that I have lately declared unto you is true, ye ought to look upon it both as your duty and concernment to be perfect. The only doubt is, whether the premiſes upon which this inference is grounded, be not the whole diſcourſe from the 17. <hi>Verſe</hi> to the end, or it be the latter part of the diſcourſe, <hi>Verſe</hi> 45, for indeed there is juſt ground for ſuch an inference from either; its very rational to diſcourſe either way, as thus:</p>
            <p>Seeing that the Law which Chriſt the eternal Son of God came to eſtabliſh is no imperfect Law, for it does not only regulate the outward, but the inward man alſo, and conſequently its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging authority and directing efficacy reaches the whole man, as to all his Thoughts, Affections, Words, Carriages, Wayes and Doings, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes thoſe who profeſs ſubjection to this Law,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59183:6"/> not to content themſelves with ſuch an imperfect obſervation of it, as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſes</hi> took up with; it becomes thoſe who have ſuch an exact rule to direct them, as the <hi>perfect Law;</hi> ſuch an excellent example to excite them as the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect God,</hi> to endeavour being perfect as their Heavenly Father is perfect. Or thus, ſeeing that God whoſe Children you profeſs your ſelves to be, has not only a love for Friends, but Enemies, as doth ſufficiently appear in that he expreſſes it to both, doing <hi>Good to the evill, and Good, &amp;c.</hi> And ſeeing that to have and expreſs this love, is his perfection, we are every way obliged and Concerned too, as we would pleaſe God and reſemble our beſt Father, in that which really is, and by him is reputed, his Chief perfection, to be as he is, and do as he do's, <hi>viz.</hi> Not only to love Friends but Enemies too.</p>
            <p>This is the way to be what, every one does na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaly with great vehemency, deſire, both for the honour, and the happineſs which it brings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it. Perfect in that, with the higheſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which a Creatures utmoſt capacity can take in; its moſt ſoaring ambition can hope for. Now though either of theſe reaſonings be cogent enough, yet the latter ſeems beſt to fit the context, and to fall in with the words [<hi>That ye may be the Children of your Father which is in Heaven, for he makes his Sun to riſe on the evill and on the good,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Be ye therefore perfect, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the importance and ſence of the words
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59183:6"/> as they lye intire in themſelves, they contain in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> An <hi>inſinuation,</hi> that the univerſall Love which every way demonſtrates it ſelfe to be in God; is the chief Perfection of that God, who is every way perfect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> An <hi>exhortation</hi> unto a great duty, with motives to induce to it, and directions to guide us in it. The duty exhorted to, is to be perfect, that is, to Endeavour after perfection, for that is our work; but to Make us perfect is God's. the motive to perſwade to this duty is becauſe God is perfect, and by coming to be perfect, we ſhall come to be like him. And this will both Become us, for its a ſeemely thing for Children to reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their Father; and it will Advantage us alſo, for certainly what is the Perfection of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Heaven can be no Diminution to the Children on Earth. The direction to guide in the practiſe of this duty is; in our purſuit after perfection, to take heed we be not deceived with the name without the thing, and that we may not be deceived here, to keep continually in our eye the perfection of God as the Star to ſtear by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. 1ſt. Vniverſal Love is the Chiefe perfection of God himſelfe. Chriſt,</hi> when he has once averr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that God <hi>makes his Sun to Riſe on the evil and on the good &amp;c.</hi> makes account that he has fully demonſtrated God to be perfect, and there needs no further proof of this, therefore in ſtead of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59183:7"/> proving the point he applyes it, and bids them be perfect as God is. Now Chriſt diſcourſe would not be coherent, vnleſs we did Suppoſe that Gods being ſo good, as to ſerve both good and bad, with his Sun and raine, was all one with his being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. There are indeed in God other excellency<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, there is his <hi>Wiſdome</hi> wherby he underſtands all perſons and affaires thoroughly, and knowes how to overrule them ſo as to make them ſerue his owne ends; Yea even then when they moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, deſigne, and endeavour to oppoſe them. There is his <hi>power</hi> whereby he is able compleatly to effect whatever he intends, without the leaſt help of the creature, in ſpite of all oppoſition which can poſſibly be made either by the whole World or Hell or both vnited. There is his <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> which makes him to deteſt all violations of right, by whom ſoever, ſo that he will neither do wrong himſelfe nor ſuffer others to do it, if by any ways where it is fit and honourable for him to interpoſe, he can prevent it. And if by his commands and threats he connot reſtraine Sin he will by his Severityes againſt the Sinner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that he does not at all approve of it. And all theſe excellencies are in God in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Gods <hi>Wiſdome</hi> is without the leaſt allay of folly, though its obſerued that there are few great wits in the world but they have ſome flaw in them, betraying them to imbrace ſome odd op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions which ſcarce any in their wits can look upon as the leaſt probable. Gods <hi>power</hi> is not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59183:7"/> capable of either being reſiſted with open force, or evaded by Subtle practics, or wearied by tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and toylſome exerciſe of it, for it is all act and every way infinite. Gods <hi>Juſtice</hi> holds an even ballance, and inclines neither to the rigour of <hi>Severity,</hi> nor to the looſneſs of <hi>lenity;</hi> it wholy overlookes perſons, and only conſiders cauſes, <hi>to render to every man according to his deeds, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect of perſons Romans</hi> 2, 6. 11. Every thing is then in its higheſt degree, where it is moſt eſſential; Thus heat in fire is more Vehement then in Water becauſe in fire it is eſſential being agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto that eſſence from which it flowes, and finding nothing within to give the leaſt check unto it; but in water it is accidentall, it com's from without and meets with ſome thing within which is continually oppoſing it. Now all theſe excell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, as they are originally in God and derived from him into the creatures, like ſtreames which Jſſue from the fountaine; ſo they are eſſentially in God flowing immediately and neceſſarily from his very nature, and therefore they are all infinite and conſequently perfect like this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> theſe are perfections in God for he would not be a God, <hi>that is,</hi> a being every way the beſt, if he wanted any of theſe <hi>excellencyes</hi> or had them not all in the <hi>higheſt degree.</hi> For the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per notion of a God is ſuch a being as neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprehends in it all kinds and degrees of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencys. Yet of all exellencyes which are in God if we may be allowed to compare one infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59183:8"/> thing with another, and where every thing is the beſt in its kind to give a preference to one before another; God's Love and goodneſs is the Cheifeſt. Now theſe in God are Vniverſall, not limited to times, places, or perſons; But are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to eternity, diffuſing themſelves over the whole Vniverſe, <hi>Heaven, Earth,</hi> I had allmoſt ſaid <hi>Hell</hi> too, For;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> They are Naturall to God and Act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner of Naturall Agents, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſatily not Arbitrarly, it being naturall unto fire to make hott, wherever it be, it muſt diffuſe heat, though poſſibly it may meet with many bodys which will not receive, and take in, the heat, which is brought unto them. Love is not in God as its ſubject, but it is in God as his very nature; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God muſt be always Loving, becauſe <hi>He is Love its ſelfe'</hi> 1. <hi>John,</hi> 4. 16. And ſo may as eaſily ceaſe to be God as ceaſe to love, <hi>Indeed</hi> when Scripture ſaith I <hi>will have mercy on whom I will have mercy Rom.</hi> 9. 15. Some might hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that God letts out his Love <hi>Arbitrarily;</hi> So that he might keep it in, if he pleaſed. And its true he might do ſo, if he could be pleaſed to do ſo. But he cannot, there is ſuch a perfect harmony betwixt his will and nature, that what ever his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is inclined to, his will is ſatiſfied in; <hi>And where the inclinations of his nature, the dictates of his Judgment, and the choice of his will concur, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall hinder the workings of mercy towards that perſon;</hi> And therefore where God will have
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59183:8"/> mercy the poor Sinner ſhall find mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly. They are infinite in God.</hi> Indeed all Gods attributes muſt of neceſſity be infinite, becauſe he has them of himſelfe, and its contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of every being to ſet bounds unto its owne excellencyes; nothing therefore has finite excell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies but what has its being from another, who both made it and Limited it, gave it its being and its bounds, Now if Gods Love and goodneſs be Infinite they muſt be Univerſall, becauſe what is Infinite is as great as great can be, and can have nothing greater then its ſelf, but a love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which do extend to all are certainly greater then theſe which extend only to ſome few.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection.</hi> But if God's Love and goodneſs be Univerſall, then it muſt needs work towards all, and if it do ſo then all muſt be benefited by it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer, 1ſt.</hi> Its true all are benefited by it, for from this love of God, all receive their being, and Life; the conveniencies and comforts of this life, more or leſs, the meanes whereby they may be advanced to, and aſſured of a better, whatever hearts they have to make uſe of theſe means, whatever Wiſdom and grace and comfort any receive in the conſciencious uſe of theſe means.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> That ſome are not more advantaged by this Love and Goodneſs, it is not becauſe this Love and Goodneſs, is a wanting to them, but they are a wanting to it, and their own intreſts. For men are not capable of the higheſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of love and goodneſs till firſt they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59183:9"/> be fitted for them, and the fitting for theſe being a work of Common grace is carried on by ſuch a power, in ſuch a way, as is reſiſtible, for though a Man cannot quicken and ſave himſelf; yet without doubt he having <hi>free Will enough</hi> to do <hi>evill</hi> he may <hi>deſtroy</hi> and ruine himſelf, he may <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt</hi> that grace which he is obliged and concerned to follow, and which if he did follow, ſo far as he may, and ought, it would lead him to an higher degree of grace, which would lead him unto happineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> If God love all, then he muſt hate none yet the <hi>Scripture</hi> Declares that he hates ſome, <hi>The covetous the Lord abhors Pſ.</hi> 10. 3. <hi>The wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and him that loves Violence his Soul hates Pſl.</hi> 11. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> God while he hates and threatens and puniſhes them, ſtill loves them, he loves the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whileſt he deteſts the vice; he loves them as they are his creatures, as they continue what he has made them, and hates them onely as they have marred themſelves; and indeed it is Gods love to them which makes him hate them, for he onely hates them as they are enemies to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as well as him; and all Gods threatenings and puniſhments unto the worſt of men, during this life, have a naturall Subſerviency to reclaim them from thoſe principles and practiſes, which are oppoſite unto their intereſts, and diſtructive unto their Souls; God by his Judgments en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to imbitter unto them all Sinfull habitts
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59183:9"/> and acts, that hereby he may cauſe them to caſt them off with deteſtation, <hi>ſaying get ye hence;</hi> If any thing take men off from the pleaſure of Sin, it muſt be feeling the Smart, which it occaſions.</p>
            <p>And this Univerſall love and goodneſs is in God one of his Cheif perfections; we may well count it ſo, when the <hi>wiſe God</hi> who knowes how to ſet a due eſtimate upon every excellency, does give the precedency to this, Hence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt,</hi> He <hi>delights moſt in it,</hi> now every one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights moſt in that which beſt ſuits him, and he apprehends moſt good in; If therefore the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing God be not miſtaken in his apprehenſions, that muſt have the <hi>greateſt goodneſs</hi> in it, the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof excites in him the <hi>higheſt pleaſure.</hi> Now its goodneſs and the exerciſe of it that God moſt delights in, and he proclaims it to all that he is for this; <hi>I am the Lord which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe loving kindneſs &amp;c.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59183:10"/> and does with the greateſt eaſe with the leaſt reluctancy, what it is every way the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in.</p>

               <hi>2dly.</hi> He glories moſt of it, and truely he is but of a very weak Judgment, who being endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with many excellencies, pitches upon one of the meaneſt and loweſt to make his boaſt of, and prizes himſelf moſt for that which is of the leaſt worth. When <hi>Moſes</hi> had a great deſire to ſee Gods glory, and God was willing to comply with him in this deſire, he onely tels him, <hi>Ile make all my goodneſs paſs before thee, Exod.</hi> 33. 19 And God who beſt knew his own excellencies, and the true value of each, when he had a mind to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play them in their greateſt luſtre, and to become his own Herald in ſetting forth his moſt glorious titles, inſiſts upon thoſe moſt which ſpeaks love and goodneſs under their different habitudes and opperations <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6. <hi>The Lord God merciful and gracious, longſuffering, and abundent in goodneſs and truth, keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving &amp;c.</hi> As Muſitians meeting with a pleaſant note diſcant and quaver moſt on that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly. He is moſt exerciſed in it,</hi> Love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs runs through all Gods providences, which are but a <hi>texture</hi> of <hi>Goodneſs, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power;</hi> But that which makes up moſt of the providence, and is moſt conſpicuous in it, is <hi>goodneſs;</hi> wheras the wiſdom of it is not deſcernable but by a peircing eye and upon a cloſe veiw. Men are moſt exerciſed in that which either they take moſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59183:10"/> pleaſure in, it beſt agreeing with their inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or they expect moſt glory from, it ſerving to diſplay their cheif excellency; Now certainly what the moſt perfect <hi>being</hi> takes greateſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in, muſt have in it the higheſt <hi>perfection,</hi> what the moſt wiſe <hi>being</hi> Judges matter of the higheſt Glory, ſure has the greateſt <hi>worth</hi> in it. <hi>All the paths as well as wayes of the Lord are mercy and truth Pſ.</hi> 25. 10. The <hi>Church</hi> takes notice of nothing ſo much in all Gods providences about her, as his mercy and goodneſs, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 136. 1. 26. <hi>He is good, his mercy endures for ever,</hi> She thought that whatever elſe there was in providence; there was enough of this, ſhe thought alſo ſhe could give no higher commendations unto pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, then to ſay their was much of mercy in it.</p>
            <p>View but all Gods works from the begining to the end, his work of Creation, Conſervaſion, Gubernation, Redemption, Sanctification, Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, ſome of which all men are concerned in, and better for, and you ſhall find a continued vein of goodneſs run through all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> He does moſt concerne himſelf to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote this in the world, Now every thing dos moſt endeavour to communicate that which it moſt excells in, thus the fire diffuſes its heat, the Sun diſperſes its light, every thing by generation mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplys its owne peculiar nature. And obſerve God, and you ſhall find that it is not ſo much modes and faſhions of Religion, as love and goodneſs
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59183:11"/> which God moſt ſtands upon, Theſe are the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall parts of Religion, and the immutable parts, others as they are accidentall ſo they are various. <hi>Love</hi> is the ſumm of the Law <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 39, 40. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 9, 10. <hi>owe no Man any thing &amp;c.</hi> Ye have the vaſt body of the Law epitomized here. Thus <hi>Chymiſts</hi> can reduce the vertues of Herbs and Mineralls into a very little roome, drawing of the Eſſences and Spirits, and leaving the groſs matter behind. Love is the end of the law, <hi>The end of the law is Charity</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. This is that which the Law aimes to bring Men too, and when it has once brought Men to this, it has done its work. Love is the great deſigne of ordin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, what Chriſt moſt prayes for. <hi>That they all may be one as thou father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us. Joh.</hi> 17. 21. What the Miniſters of Chriſt ſhould moſt preach up, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 1. 2. <hi>If there be therefore any conſolation in Chriſt, if any comfort of love &amp;c.</hi> And indeed the main edification is in love <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>Unto the edifying it ſelf in love.</hi> Its alſo the great deſigne of providences. Does God carry loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his people it is to teach them to love one another, <hi>Love one another as I have loved you. Joh.</hi> 15. 12. Does he carry angrily towards them, he does but whip them round, to make them kiſs one another, falls out with them all, that he may make them agree better among themſelves.</p>
            <p>If ye ask what peculiar excellency there is in love which gives it the preheminence to all other attributes.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59183:11"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> 1ſt. It perfects that in God which is the Cheif faculty in him. In every rationall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there are three Facultys, the <hi>Appetitive Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> the will, which carries out to deſire what is agreeable to its nature; The <hi>Directive Faculty,</hi> the vnderſtanding which both diſcouer, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which is deſirable, and propounds to the Choice the various methods and means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the good deſired may be attained; And the <hi>executive</hi> faculty, which wants a peculiar name, whereby the methods and means pitcht upon by Choice are applied for the attaining the good deſired. Now of theſe three facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes the appetitive is the Chief, it being the Spring unto the other two, to ſet them upon motion, and keeping a hand over them ſo as to reſtrain them when it pleaſes; the Will fits as Queen having the underſtanding beſides it for its Councellour; the executive faculty below it for its Miniſter to act.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, whereas there are three habits to perfect theſe three facultys, that which perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Cheif muſt be the Cheif of them, and conſequently <hi>love</hi> which perfects the <hi>Will</hi> muſt have the preheminence of <hi>wiſdom,</hi> which perfects the underſtanding; and of <hi>Power</hi> which perfects the Motive faculty. Now though in God by reaſon of the purity and ſimplicity of the Divine nature we cannot ſo properly diſtinguiſh theſe faculties, yet being found in the Choiceſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and being acknowledged excellencyes in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59183:12"/> them, they cannot be wanting in God himſelf but muſt be in him though in a more eminent manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> It moſt Clearly diſtinguiſhes God from all other beings, every thing is diſtinguiſhed from all other things by that which is its Choiceſt perfection. Thus it being the Cheif excellency of man that he is able to take a view of Severall things at once, and to compare one thing with another, and from principles evident in themſelves to deduce concluſions which are more obſcure, hence he is diſtinguiſhed from all bruits by this one thing that he is a rationall creature; Thus <hi>Love</hi> being the Cheif perfection of God he is diſtinguiſhed from all other things by this, that <hi>he is Love,</hi> the beſt that can be ſaid of any other being is, that it has love.</p>
            <p>And as God is the moſt excellent being in the world, ſo the Devil is the baſeſt, and the main thing wherein God dos moſt evidently differ from the Devill, is not either wiſdom or power, for the Devil has a great deal of both theſe, though its true they are but <hi>finite</hi> in him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they are <hi>infinite</hi> in God, but its love and goodneſs, for there is not the leaſt of theſe in the <hi>Divell,</hi> and the very want of theſe makes him a <hi>Divell,</hi> were he not ſo full of malice and naughtineſs as he is, ſo imutably Settled in theſe as he is, he would not be what he is, a <hi>Devill,</hi> Nay ſhould it be granted what ſome of Old have ſtrongly fancyed (though againſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59183:12"/> all reaſon) that there were two <hi>infinite</hi> beings the one <hi>good,</hi> the other <hi>bad,</hi> the bad would have all other perfections beſides goodneſs equal unto the good, and for want of <hi>this one perfection,</hi> it being the main it would not be God. for God and the Cheife good are all one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> It has the Soveraigne command of all other excellencies in God. There is nothing but what is excellent in God, and no excellency in him, but what is either a part of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or a Servant to it. <hi>Gods pitty</hi> is but good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to thoſe in miſery, <hi>his mercy,</hi> is but his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to thoſe that are Sinfull, as well as miſerable; <hi>Nay</hi> Gods Juſtice which Seemes moſt oppoſite to his goodneſs, is but goodneſs exerting it ſelfe with vehemency and indignation againſt that in men and Devils, which moſt hinders goodneſs from Communicating it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>As for Gods <hi>Wiſdome</hi> and <hi>power</hi> theſe attend on goodneſs to execute its commands. Wiſdome has no other work then to contrive the readieſt way to do the moſt good, and power is wholy imployed in removing thoſe obſtacles which hinder the doing of good.</p>
            <p>That therefore which do's moſt ſway with God in all his actings, and has ſo great an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon all his attributes, to point them what way to ſteer, muſt needs be a very eminent perfection in God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> The diſplaying of love and goodneſs
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59183:13"/> do's moſt tend to the glorifing of God, I know not whether this do more prove love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be the <hi>prime perfectoon</hi> of God or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate why it ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abſolute Supermacy</hi> how highly ſoever it may be prized by fooliſh and proud men, yet God do's not look upon it as becoming himſelf, and therefore, though he may pretend to it as Juſtly as any elſe, yet he Counts it not worth his Claim. When he is Challenged for unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by vnreaſonable perſons, he alleadges not, that he being the greateſt in the world may do what ever he liſt without Controul, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving account, but he pleads his own cauſe and ſubmits his providences to the ſevereſt cenſure, of thoſe who have reaſon, and will Judge indifferently, <hi>Exek.</hi> 18. 25. He accounts it a far greater honour to be reputed a grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous King then a great tyrant. <hi>Wiſdom</hi> though it paſs among men for a very choice excellency, as indeed it is. <hi>The excellency of a Man, as a Man</hi> that wherin he does greatly tranſcend brutes, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59183:13"/> thing, for any to be in a capacity to do what ever they have a mind, none being able to oppoſe them, but certainly if a mighty man be not a good man too, he may be feared, as Devils are in ſome places, and tyrants every where, but he ſhall never be intirely Loved and Cordially honoured.</p>
            <p>The onely thing therefore, that does diſcover how excellent a being God is, how amiable and honourable he is, that ſetts forth his glory unto the life; and repreſents him in ſuch a way that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one is ready to love him, adore him, admire him, every one according to the <hi>Principle</hi> they are acted by, ſuch as are <hi>truely gracious in a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious way,</hi> and ſuch as are ſtill in their naturall eſtate, according to the inclinations of naturall ingenuity, the dictates of naturall Conſciences, I ſay the only thing which does make the moſt lovely repreſentation of God, is his carring on things ſo, that it may evidently appear that he has no deſigne upon any, and that he does hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>Its true, God is ſo abſolute in his ſupremacy that he might do whatever pleaſes him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being in danger of being called to account by any; he is ſo mighty in his Power that

Can theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the end of that <hi>Religion,</hi> whoſe precepts, promiſes, examples, does aime all at love and Charity? There is one <hi>Religion</hi> which has the inpudence to Condemn all <hi>Religions</hi> beſides its ſelfe, and for the moſt part finds the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that it metes out to others, being condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59183:15"/> by all others, and one of the maine things which ſhe is Juſtly blamed for, is that vncharit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs ſhe ſhewes to all but her ſelf; wherein ſhe is too much followed by the moſt that Seperate from her.</p>
            <p>But let <hi>Religions</hi> pretend never ſo ſpeciouſly, ſo long as the true Nature of God is underſtood, which is love and goodneſs, ſo long as the main deſigne of <hi>Religion</hi> is underſtood, which is to advance men unto that frame of Spirit, which is moſt conſpicuous in God, that <hi>Religion</hi> will never be imbraced which ownes, any thing contrary unto true love and goodneſs.</p>
            <p>And certainly there is little love ſhewed unto thoſe perſons who, ſuppoſe they be in an errour are forthwith ſent to Hell to carry their errour, with them; And as little love to others who poſſibly by crueltyes may be terifyed, but will never be Convinced.</p>

And in this notion of perfection I underſtand the word 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 10.

               <hi>Vſe.</hi> 1. Is it our duty to ſeek and preſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fter <hi>Perfection,</hi> then certainly it is our Sin, and our reproach, and ſhould be our greife, that we do ſo little concerne our ſelves about <hi>Perfection,</hi> as we do, yea it ſhould be our ſhame too, when every thing is preſſing after <hi>Perfecton.</hi> There is nothing in nature, which is at reſt, for its aſpiring after Perfection, though it ſpend it ſelfe by this induſtrious purſute after Perfection, and expire; As when the herb with much bearing has grown up into a flower it then begins to decline, and wither; ſhall man only content himſelfe with an Imperfect ſtate, though he be the choiceſt peice of Gods creation, capable of the higheſt Perfection, whereunto he is deſigned, a Perfection, moſt ſublime moſt durable: When every one endeavours to be Perfect, in the art which he profeſſes, the Councellor, in the Skill of law, the phiſician, in the Skill of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and reſtoring health, preventing and Curing deſeaſes. Is it not a ſhame that a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an who profeſſes the Skill of vanquiſhing the World, and Hell, of curing the moſt deſperate deſeaſes of Souls, of heaping up a bank of true Riches, which will never be exhauſted to all eternity, that he ſhould not care though he be a bungler in this art of arts. What thoughts do we take, what inquiries do we make, what endeavours do we uſe, that we may be Perfect? Can we tell what? re we not aſhamed they
<pb facs="tcp:59183:23"/> are ſo few? Were we not at all concerned here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, whether we be Perfect or we be not, the matter were the leſs weighty, but when it is impoſſible we ſhould be happy, vnleſs we be Perfect, and we can never hope to eſcape the curſe of the <hi>Perfect Law,</hi> nor to ſtand the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Perfect God</hi> any other wayes, is it not palpable folly, nay extreame madneſs to neglect it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> Is it our duty, to preſs after Perfection? Let us make it our care, ſtudy to excell our ſelves, excell others, to be every way Perfect, let us make that our buſineſs while we live which we ſhall wiſh when we come to die, we had made our buſineſs.</p>
            <p>In order hereunto let us,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> Endeavour to be ſenſible of our great imperfection, our extreme want of uſefull know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſaveing grace, ſolid comfort, our unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitableneſs under mercies, Judgments, meanes, our awkwardneſs to carry like Chriſtians, in thoſe various Changes we vndergo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> See the great worth and uſe of Perfection, how ſubſervient it is to God's Glory, the good of our ſelves and others; certainly the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Chriſtians, are every way beſt fitted for the improuement of all opportunityes of doing, and getting good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> Learn the way to attaine Perfection. Accuſtome your ſelves to have mean thoughts of your ſelves, live up to light, and ſtrength,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59183:24"/> in obeying God and denying your ſelves. Keep daily in your eye <hi>Perfection,</hi> as the mark to Aime at, the goal to run to, Vſe all meanes of Perfection, reading the moſt Spirituall Books, hearing the moſt ſpirituall Preachers converſing with the moſt ſpirituall Perſons;</p>

            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> It's moſt ſutable to a Chriſtians Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and Spirit; wherein there is all Meekneſs, Lowlineſs, Love and Tenderneſs; which when any Swarve from (whatever it be they do, be it never ſo good in its ſelf) they do it othere
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59183:29"/> wiſe then they ought to do; Now a <hi>meek Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> does Naturally forbear, what meerely tends to provoke others; an <hi>humble Soul</hi> is ready to ſuſpect his own Judgment; And to believe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may vnderſtand himſelf, as well, if not better, in that buſineſs than himſelf; a Loving Heart is very loth to diſpleaſe, when there is no need.</p>
            <p>

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59183:30"/> has ſo little influence upon the Heart, to the purging it from paſſion: Beſides, Men have a prejudice againſt ſuch as deal roughly with them and cannot eaſily think they mean them any great good, and therefore expect little from them, and ſo attend not, however <hi>Scolding is no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to convince People they are in an Errour,</hi> neither is it the way to bring Men into the Truth to knock it into your heads with Hammers; <hi>Men are men, and muſt be dealt with as rationall Creatures;</hi> if you wou'd perſwade them, you muſt ſpeak to their Reaſons, and Conſciences, or you may as well hold your Tongue; if you Provoke, you do but <hi>bemud Mens minds,</hi> ſo that they cannot take in the <hi>cleare Light of your Argument.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly. It is but a due Conforming to the moſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally acknowledged precept of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> The cleareſt Rule of Equity in Nature. Chriſt bids his Diciples <hi>Love one another;</hi> This is granted on all ſides; not one amongſt the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Sects of Chriſtian Religion has the Face to deny this; Some indeed do queſtion whether Chriſt do require of thoſe that profeſs him, that they ſhould do it by taking up, and tying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to any outward obſervance whatever, and ſo for other things; yet whileſt thoſe that do go under the Name of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> differ al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in every thing elſe; (ſome or other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently denying, and that not without very high pretences of Rational and Scripturall
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59183:30"/> grounds, what others with as full perſwaſons aſſert, ſome or other ſlighting as a ſuperſtitious invention of man, what others very <hi>Religiouſly</hi> obſerve as an ordinance of Chriſt) how ever all agree in this, that <hi>Chriſtians are bound by Chriſt's precept to Love one another.</hi> Now I am ſure did but people charge their Conſciences more with the diſcharging of this <hi>moſt unqueſtionable duty of Love,</hi> there would be leſs need of calling them ſo much to <hi>Moderation.</hi> For if we do but obſerve the working of that naturall inclination and paſſion, which the World uſually gives the name of Love unto; And withall, do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what a powerfull influence it has upon <hi>Parents, Lovers, Friends,</hi> to the ſweeting even the ſowreſt diſpoſition, towards thoſe they Love; If we mind how many <hi>Diſtempers, affection bears with, how many vices it winks at, how many faults it excuſes, how many provocations it puts up and paſſes by;</hi> Can we imagine that the <hi>Love, which is commanded by Chriſt, wrought by the Spirit, and is a very reall participation of the divine nature,</hi> Should come ſo far ſhort of this? Can we think that this more large, noble, pure ſtrong principle, were it indeed in us, would not reſtrain us from quarrelling with one another? Becauſe our Brothers Head is not, as big as ours, becauſe he cannot believe what we call white, is ſo; Untill he ſee it to be ſo with his own eyes; Becauſe he deſires he may not be tyed to our Spectacles, and takes upon him to wear Cloaths not of The
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59183:31"/> ſame colour and ſhape with ours.</p>
            <p>And let me tell you ſome <hi>underſtanding and conſcientious Perſons</hi> are of the mind, that when once the Righteous and Alwiſe God <hi>Shall ſet up his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall Judgment, ask Whats the matter, and weigh the ſeverall pretences, as one day he will,</hi> many of thoſe <hi>hot conteſts</hi> which are kept up amongſt Chriſtians with ſo bitter animoſities almoſt on all ſides, will be found able to produce no fairer grounds to Juſtify their unchriſtian Janglings, there thoſe Juſt now mentioned.</p>
            <p>You ſee then that while Chriſt does expreſly command us <hi>to Love one another,</hi> Yea all men, even Enemys, he does <hi>vertually and conſequentially</hi> forbid us to uſe towards any upon any pretence of difference whatſoever ſuch words and carriages as we could never uſe towards them, did we but Love them, though but with the Love of the World.</p>
            <p>Neither muſt we expect that ſuch a ſlender <hi>Plea as a pretence that it is in the cauſe of God and Religion,</hi> will ſerve our turne to Juſtify us in the ſight of God, for a breach of the higheſt and moſt undoubted law of Chriſt: any more then the <hi>Phariſees, Crying It's Corban</hi> could excuſe them while they refuſed to ſupply the neceſſiti's of their <hi>poor Parents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay rather it will be an agravation of our Sin, while we <hi>Patronize</hi> it upon God, and make <hi>Religion</hi> a Sanctuary for wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>

            <p>Now look a little into your owne hearts, ask your ſelves, <hi>would I willingly, were I in a miſtake, be Derided for it, Upbraided with it, Perſecuted for it, ſhould I not Judge it more reaſonable, that others ſhould pitty me, endeavour to Convince me,</hi> Suppoſing the Errour to be dangerous; Does not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt damage accrew to my ſelfe thereby.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>6ly.</hi> To do otherwiſe is but to miſimploy that Heat, Vigour, Vehemency, which God has put into us, unto another uſe then God intended it; For God intended this <hi>Zeale</hi> for the conſumeing of our owne Luſts, not the ſingeing, ſmutting of our Brothers Name, this fire in us was made to warm our Neighbours not to ſcorch and Burne
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59183:32"/> them, and ſhall we make no better reckoning of Gods gifts then to waſt and abuſe them: Do our ſelves and others harm by that which God ment for both our Goods; may not this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke God to keep his mercys to himſelf, and not put them into Childrens hands to Cut their own Fingers and to Slaſh their Neighbours with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7ly. It is an unreaſonable thing to be more Seven in ſmaller Crimes, then we allow our ſelves to be in greater.</hi>

            <p>But let a <hi>poor honeſt Soul</hi> while he is <hi>Sincere and earneſt in the purſute after truth,</hi> But ſtumble into an Errour, or what is accounted ſo, we preſently Cry <hi>Heretick,</hi> oh take heed of him, Come not neare him, it is not fit ſuch an one ſhould breath, <hi>Crucifie him.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> Is an Errour more Infectious, and catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; I am ſure there are many that do not ſo much ſuite and gratify our Corrupt inclinations as theſe Luſts do; Nay ſome there are that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59183:32"/> thwart Mans naturall Bent, moſt oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bring them into contempt; reproach, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſufferings; And here I believe the <hi>naturall ſelf-Love</hi> which is in moſt, will make them wary before they engage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> But it may be its more dangerous if it ſhould take.</p>
            <p>Indeed 'tis poſſible ſuch it may be, as a miſtake in the way may hinder one more in their reaching their Journeys end, then a fall or two.</p>
            <p>But as there are many uſeleſs truths ſo many innocent Errours, all the harme they do, is but to the Perſons themſelves: And theſe rather expoſe to outward trouble (which God oft times ſanctifies to them for the good of their Souls) then incline or encourage to Sin or hinder the work of holineſs in their hearts, do they, not walk as cloſely with God, grow as much in Spirituallity, Heavenly mindedneſs, in reall and ſolid Grace, (notwithſtanding their miſtakes,) as others with all their Orthodoxe knowledge.</p>
            <p>And let me tell you God will one day enquire, not how ingenious we have begn in our <hi>Religion,</hi> but how ſincere, diligent, faithfull; not what our opinions have been, but our graces, not how we have talked, but how we have lived.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> What then; is it a greater Sin to Live in a miſtake then to Live in Drunkeneſs, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Profaneneſs; poſſibly I might thinke ſo too, could I be perſwaded that a miſtake does more harme to Souls, is leſs Conſiſtant with
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59183:33"/> Sincerity and honeſty, is more contrary to the Spirit of Piety and Holyneſs, layes more blocks in the way to Love, Meekneſs, Lowlineſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, faith, indiſpoſes more to obedience and ſelf denyal.</p>
            <p>But untill I can meet with ſome <hi>Sober Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Perſons</hi> who are given to theſe, and thinke they ought to be ſo, perſwade themſelves they are pleaſing and ſerving God in the mean time, as I do meet with ſeverall, whom I have reaſon to look upon as very Conſciencious in their miſtake, untill I find Drunken and Profain Perſons notwithſtanding their Drunkenneſs and Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs growing in Grace (as I find ſome Erroneous perſons notwithſtanding their errour) give me leave to queſtion whether this be the greater Sin or noe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> But it may be tis an harder Task to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare thoſe Sins then to avoid erring, there being ſo many temptations to entice us to them, ſo great a Suitableneſs in our nature to them.</p>
            <p>But do's not the Love we bear to our Credits, Eſtates, Healths, Relations, Souls, bid us refrain; do's not Conſcience, Reaſon, Scripture, Check us for them? Would not naturall principles carry us above theſe; When alaſs how eaſy a thing is it to miſtake; Even then when we are moſt deſirous to find the truth, moſt carefull in ſeeking after it. How Blind, Dark, Narrow, Shallow are our underſtandings? How many prejudices do we take in from our very Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood?
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59183:33"/> How obſcure, and dubious is Scripture, <hi>when read without the light of God?</hi> How vain uncertain <hi>are the dictates and Creeds of Synods, Councells, Churches?</hi> How little concerned do's <hi>God look upon himſelf to ſecure his People from thoſe miſtakes which he knows how to do them good by?</hi> How apt to be ſwayed with the opinion of thoſe we have an Eſteem for. If we conſider but theſe and the like occaſions of miſtake, which every one almoſt is ſurrounded with.

               <hi>2ly.</hi> This was the Apoſtles practice, for the Compoſing of thoſe many Differences of thoſe Times between the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> Chriſtians; They do not <hi>Magiſterially dictate</hi> this is truth, and who ever thinks or ſayes otherwiſe are Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.

When for the recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the health of our Bodies, encreaſing our Eſtates, the Scruing our ſelves into the fauour of ſome particular Perſons, the heightening of our Reputations, we count no Care, no Induſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to much, we ſpare no paines, we are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall enough of our time, leaving no Friend un-conſulted, noe interreſt unimproved; But let the Soul be never ſo Sick, famiſhed for the word of Life; Impoveriſhed of the true Riches, we can fit ſtill, as Perſons not concern'd, trouble no body with ſuch Idle queſtions, <hi>as how we may get our Souls ſaved;</hi> we can content our ſelves with <hi>any Sermons,</hi> though they never come home to our Conſciences; ſpend Sabbaths after Sabbaths, in vaine diſcourſes, ſports, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>7ly.</hi> When we are more angry at thoſe that hinder us from getting that outward comfort, which we have moſt mind to, then we are with thoſe, who by their company or example, make our Spirits more dull or flat, more dead and cold, more formall and Carnal, leſs to prize, reliſh, and ſeek after Holineſs and Heavenly mindedneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>8ly.</hi> When in diſpoſing our Selves or Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the World, as to Callings, Services; or Marriags; we more conſider what probably may be for their outward eaſe, Pleaſure and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then for the good of their Souls, for the, Begetting, Cheriſhing, Increaſing and Strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening of grace in them.

            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> When for the Attaining of any of theſe things our hearts hanker after, we will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to do any thing which ought not to be done, which may bring reproach upon <hi>Religion</hi> and the name of God, ſuch as fraud, injuſtice for getting of Eſtates; and when we quarrel with thoſe that ſtand in our way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> When our hearts are ſo upon rheſe, that we cannot be without them, all our Comforts gone if here we be Croſſed; when we Count life it ſelf not worth the having upon theſe terms, if we have not what we deſire, or loſe what we love, we throw up all. Thus being brought under the Power of them, we have not them but they us.</p>

            <p>THE Firſt particle in the text ſhews the words to be rationall, and bids us look Back to enquire what it is in the forgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the Chapter, which they give an account of. There we find the Lord turning from the People whom he had Charged with ſeverall Miſcarriages, unto the Preiſts, <hi>Verſe</hi> 1. And them he tells he had a word for <hi>even for them,</hi> A Word of <hi>Injunction Verſe.</hi> 2. To heare and take notice of the great provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among the People, and to lay it to Heart as a matter ſadly to be Lamented, being bad in its Nature, dangerous in its Conſequences; And not to reſt here in a Fruitleſs Greiving for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of the great God, and the ſins, Miſeries and dangers of a poor People, but to turne their ſorrow into <hi>Zeal,</hi> and to take an Effectuall courſe to ſecure the <hi>Sinking intereſt of the Nation,</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59183:45"/> God his due, and giving him againe the Glory he had been defrauded of. A Word of <hi>Comination</hi> to back this, either do as I Charge you or look to your ſelves, ſeverall Bleſſings ye enjoy, I beleeve you would not willingly part with them, but take what other Courſe you will they ſhall be all blaſted, if I ſuffer the Curſe to come among you that will make havock, and I will be ſo far from reſtraining it, that I my ſelf will ſend it. A word of <hi>Commemoration</hi> to drive all home, did I ſay I would Curſe you, ye may well truſt me for I have already begun and that upon your neglect herein; <hi>If Judgments threatned cannot awake you, pray let Judgments inflicted do it, though you may put by your Feares, ſure you cannot put off your feeling too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But leaſt all this ſhould be too little to work them up to a real Reformation, he goes two ſteps further.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> The threatening which he ſeemed to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the execution of, untill he had made ſome tryall whether they would heare or no, here he denounces abſolutely without any Reſerues, leaſt they ſhould at leaſt delay, Setting in good earneſt to return to their duty out of hopes that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would however be deferred, if it could not be reverſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> That they might be more fully poſſeſt with diſtinct apprehenſions of their danger, he repreſents it at large in two particulars, which touch nature where it has the quickeſt ſenſe.</p>
            <pb n="79" facs="tcp:59183:45"/>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> Of pain, which unavoidably follows upon the Cutting of all hopes, of not only the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts but the Neceſſary ſupports of nature, while he threatens to Corrupt the very firſt principle, the ſeed of theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> Of ſhame, when that which ſhould be the higheſt Honour, Proves the Greateſt diſgrace, and dung is as it were taken from their Sacrifices and thrown in their very faces.</p>
            <p>Now leaſt God in this way of Proceeding ſhould be taxed of too much ſeverity; he for the Vindication of himſelf declares,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> That there is Love in all this, and great Love too. The deſign of all his threatnings and Chaſtizings being only to reduce them to their primitive purity, and to intereſt them in thoſe priviledges which the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> did at firſt enjoy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> However there is <hi>Juſtice</hi> in it, for if the Prieſts by their unfaithfulneſs in their place ſuffer the People to run into ſin, and when they have done ſo, never lay it to heart, nor endeavour to reclaim them, it is but Juſt they ſhould ſmart for it. Well, therefore may I proceed thus rigorouſly againſt the Prieſts—<hi>For they ought, to keep knowledge;</hi> where in the whole <hi>Verſe</hi> you have,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt. The Prieſts dignity declared</hi> (for the ſence is Retrograde to the Words) as deſpicable as he Looks in the eyes of the proud profane World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, he is no mean one in the Judgment of the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59183:46"/> wiſeſt, beſt and greateſt. God himſelf pitches upon him as one of ſuch Qualifications and hopes as render him fit to be truſted in an Imployment of higheſt Conſequence, a meſſage from the King of Heaven, unto the greateſt on Earth, and ſuch a Meſſage alſo as concerns them more then all their Comforts in this Life, as much as their Souls, their very Souls and their unſpeakeable, unconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able happineſs or miſery to all Eternity is worth. Men count it an Honour to be made uſe of as an Ambaſſador or Envoy to a forrain State, by one who ſetting aſide his clothes and titles, is but Fleſh and Blood like themſelves, one whoſe approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Mans abilities and Faithfulneſs, is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Teſtimony of them, his Judgment being liable to a double miſcarriage: The one by miſtake, while he preſumes the Man to be endowed with thoſe vertues and accompliſhments which he is really without, only hath the ſhadow of them.</p>
            <p>The other by miſ-valuing, while he over values his indifferent parts, and makes ſmall of his notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Vices; but here is one approved by the God of greateſt underſtanding and Wiſdom, imployed by one who is <hi>LORD,</hi> not in title but in reality. One who has the command not of one ſmall Army, but of all the forces on Earth, yea in Heaven and Hell too; The <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> of all, who has them abſolutely at his book.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly. You have upon this a double duty founded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> Of the Prieſt, therefore it is expected from him <hi>to preſerve Knowledge;</hi> Even in the moſt
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59183:46"/> corrupt and degenerate age, let him Remember whoſe buſineſs he is about, whoſe dependent he is, and let him not be Afraid of Speaking ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and vſefull truths, tho' they may thwart the Intereſts of the very Greateſt, and Provoke their Indignation againſt him, and ſo Expoſe himſelf unto Hazards, the Lord of Hoſts whoſe, Meſſenger he is, Is able to protect him in the Work he ſets him about, let the whole World and Hell too do its worſt, and he will do it in ſpite of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> Of the people, it is Juſtly expected from them, that they ſhould not onely give the Miniſter an hearing when he comes to ſeek them, but they ſhould alſo ſeek him, that they May hear at his mouth what is the Meſſage he brings from Heaven, and what the Lord requires at their hands. If they dare venture to put an affront upon the Lord of hoſts and an high one too, and Engage him againſt them, they may Suffer him to ſend on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to them about their greateſt concerns, and declare to the World that they neither Value him nor his Meſſenger nor his Meſſage any more then if it came from a vain weak Fooliſh mortall Inconſiderable man like themſelves, nay not ſo much, they'l not ſtir to the door to hear it.</p>
            <p>And all this is ſuggeſted to Juſtify God in the ſeverity he ſeemes to make Vſe of while he pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhes and threatens the Preiſts ſo very ſharply. Well may God make them ſmart with a witneſs while they ſuffer the People to diſhonour him
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59183:47"/> and undo themſelves, which poſſibly might have been prevented, if they Would be mindfull of their duty in Letting the People know theirs, and the great danger they run upon in neglecting it. Which they were much obliged to do, being ſo greatly confided in by the high God to be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by him about ſuch a meſſage, and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do, leaſt they incur the diſpleaſure of the great God the Lord of Hoſts. And pray what danger had they run upon if they had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous and Faithfull? Need they have feared to be the leaſt harmed by feeble man having the Lord of Hoſts, in whoſe Meſſage they were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, ſtanding at their back to defend them? So that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> Ye have the Improvement made of both by Application to the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. It is one of the main Dutyes of the Miniſters to preſerve Knowledge by their Lips;</hi> If by their Unfaithfulneſs in the diſcharge of this duty they Suffer people to diſhonour the great God, and ruine their Poor Souls, they have no reaſon to Quarrel with God, if he make their lives Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, and their Perſons deſpicable. <hi>Ver.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> I do not ſay that it is the duty onely of the Miniſter; No every Particular perſon has a Soul, a precious Soul to look after, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge, and real powerfull Knowledge is like to be miſerable unto all Eternity, and if it be ſo, he'l find that he himſelf is the moſt to blame; He therefore ſhould get knowledge and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59183:47"/> preſerve it in himſelf whatever it coſt him.</p>
            <p>Every Maſter of a family ſhould preſerve the Knowledge which is according to Godlineſs in his Family, and if this ſhould fail it will not Juſtify him at the great day when the Impartial God enquires how comes it to paſs that thy Wife, thy Child, thy Servants were ſo groſly Ignorant of God? And by reaſon of this are now like to be as Extreamly Miſerable? to ſay then, alaſs Lord the Miniſter did not teach them as he ought. If it be ſo as thou ſayeſt, will his Neglect of his duty Excuſe thy ſin, while thou Neglecteſt thine, or rather will it not agravate it? that when thou plainly ſeeſt the danger to be ſo Extreme great with thoſe Poor Souls, that Periſh they muſt in all likelyhood, unleſs thou took due care and paines about them to ſave them, ſeing none elſe Would heed them: thou ſeeſt them take the directeſt Courſe unto utter deſtruction, and yet for all the Love thou ſo much pretendedſt to them, never hadſt the pity to their periſhing Souls as once to aske them that ſerious Queſtion what mean you? know you whether you are going?</p>
            <p>The School-Maſter ſhould preſerve ſaving Knowledge among his Scholars; Has he not ſuch Advantages by the awe that he has them in, to mould their tender years almoſt what way he pleaſes, which few elſe have? Has he not them then under his inſtruction and diſcipline when they are not onely docible but pliable alſo? And can he ſatisfy his Conſcience, and Anſwer it to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59183:48"/> God if he Improve this opportunity no further then to inſtruct them well in the grounds of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, arts and ſciences; If he bring them under the precepts of morality and civility, ſo that they can Command their paſſions and appetites and evidence their good breeding by their ſeemly and ſober behaviour in every thing, when in the mean while he do's no more to the ſaving of the Soul, by bringing it to the true Knowledge of God in Chriſt then as if his Scholars carried no ſuch things about them: or they were onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the advantages of his life. If one of theſe Poor wretches ſhould meet his Maſter at the great day and ſay, O Maſter, I am undone and I may partly thank you for it, while I was with you in my tender age, before Cuſtome in Sin had hardened my heart, I had then ſome ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of Conſcience, and if you had but then at ſpare times minded me of my ſinfull, miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, Dangerous ſtate, you might then have put me in ſuch a way as would have ſaved me from this Endleſs Torment I am now Entering into, what will he be able to returne to this?</p>
            <p>Nor <hi>2ly.</hi> Do I ſay it is the Miniſters duty to preſerve Knowledge Meerly by his Lips. No his very life ſhould be a continuall Sermon, and in that he ſhould let People ſee Knowledge di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted into practiſe, and good inſtructions exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified before their eyes. For how can he Expect that the People ſhould believe him who Evid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences by his Contrary practiſe that he do's not
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59183:48"/> believe himſelf? or whether is it more Likely they will follow him the way he points, or the way he walks? He tells us indeed that it is our duty to do ſo and ſo, and frights us with dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dangers, if we do otherwiſe, but certainly he do's not think as he Speaks, for then he Would never do contrary; Sure he loves himſelf as well as he do's us, and he knowes what is good for himſelf; and what is good for him, can never be hurtfull for us.</p>
            <p>But this I ſay one of the great dutys of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is to preſerve knowledg and right apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in People, agreeable to the very Nature of the things, and firm Perſwaſions of the rectitude of theſe Apprehenſions, ſo as to be duly affected with thoſe, and to be Powerfully Actuated by them.</p>
            <p>If ye aske, what Knowledge? The reſolution is eaſy out of the very text; that Knowledge which would Effectually reſtrain People from thoſe practiſes, which did greatly provoke the Righteous God againſt them. And I pray you what do's skill in variety of Languages avail to this? will it reform Lives, and ſave Souls and Maintain Peace, and order, and Charity, to puzzle an Ignorant auditory with Sentences of Latin or Greek, either out of Heathen poets, or Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, or out of Fathers, Schoolmen, or Councells, that they do not the leaſt underſtand; Or if they did, they know not how far they are to be heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Will God be better ſerved, and ſuperiours
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59183:49"/> more obeyed, and Corruptions more mortified, and graces more exerciſed, and Afflictions better Improved, and our brethren more loved, and helped in the way to Heaven by the Miniſters making a buſineſs of it to Perſwade his auditours that he has a little Learning.</p>
            <p>

            <p>But for you (<hi>My Brethren</hi>) who have engaged in this great work, following the inward call of God, being fully perſwaded in your hearts, that by devoting your ſelves this way, you might do God and his People beſt ſervice, let me ſpeak a word to you and my ſelf.</p>

            <p>This is wiſely inquired, for one may be eaſily miſtaken, though one never ſo truly deſire to Act every way for the beſt, In order hereunto, that may ſeem to be the beſt, which will not really prove ſo, and therefore it is not good to be too Confident of ones own apprehenſions, to lean to ones own underſtanding. What but if I may not truſt my own Judgment, what other light have I to ſteer my ſelfe by? Would you have

            <p>HAVING diſcourſed of the firſt ſort of motives, which our Saviour makes uſe of to perſwade Men to enter in at the ſtrait Gate, I am now come to the ſecond ſort.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſort of Motives, are taken from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations of the contrary gate, and way thoſe that lead to Deſtruction; and yet are ſo Wide and Broad, that they have many Entries and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in them. The Second ſort are taken from Conſiderations had of the Strait Gate and ways, and that either, <hi>1ſt.</hi> Of the neceſſity of going in, and going on here.</p>
            <p>It is the only Way to Life thus to do, this Way leads to Life, but none elſe does, this Gate brings into this Way of Life, whereas no other Gate does; None can be careleſs whether he make Ingreſs and progreſs here, but he who ſets light by Life, that Life which for permanency and privileges doe exceedingly tranſcend this.</p>
            <pb n="124" facs="tcp:59183:68"/>
            <p>Or, <hi>2ly.</hi> Of the difficulty of going in, and going on here.</p>
            <p>A threefold difficulty is here mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> There is a difficulty in finding this Gate, and this difficulty is ſo great, that there are few overcome it. Moſt drop into deſtruction, before they know where the Gate of Salvation lies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> There is a difficulty in entring this Gate when it is found, it being a ſtrait Gate, and ſo not to be entred with any bulk, in any poſture, a Man muſt ſtrip himſelf of all unneceſſary lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and compoſe his body into the moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous poſture, if he would get in at this ſtrait Gate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> There is a difficulty in holding on in the Way, which we have entred into through the Gate, this Way being a narrow Way, ſuch as will not leave us at liberty to do as we liſt, but will confine us within bounds and tye us to good behaviour, ſo that we ſhall be neceſſitated to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our Steps unto our Ways.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. 1ſt. There is a way which leads unto Life.</hi> This is ſo clear a truth, and ſo generall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that Chriſt does not think it needfull to prove it, no nor ſo much as to aſſert it neither, he only ſuppoſes there is ſuch a way, all that he does directly aſſert, is touching the narrowneſs of this Way, and the Straitneſs of the Gate, which admits into it. Here we muſt enquire what this Life is, which has a Way to it, what
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59183:68"/> this way is which leaſts unto this Life, how this Way leads unto this Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt. 1ſt.</hi> What is this Life which has a Way leading to it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Man has a double Life</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> A Life of the Body in this World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> A life of the the Soul, which is either inchoat and begun in this World, or conſummate and perfect in the other. Now this Life of the Body conſiſts in the conjunction of the Soul and Body together, and exerts its ſelf in natural, vital, Animal operations, whereby we Eat, Drink, and Grow, and Breath, See and Hear, Smell and Feel, and Talk and Walk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is not rhe Life which we have to do with here, for we are ſpeaking of a Life which Men generally are without; yea are at a great diſtance from, and cannot arrive at, but by paſſing through a long Way, but ſuch a Life is not this preſent bodily life, for all on this ſide the Grave have this Life; The life then which we have to Enquire about, is the Life of the Soul, this men are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, unleſs they be born again to it, and they are but few who are born again, nay men are at a diſtance from this life, neither prizing this, nor deſiring it, nor knowing the way to it. Nay, it is not the life of the Soul while it is yet in the body, this vile body, which we here Enquire after; For though theſe two lives, that of the Soul here, and that of the Soul hereafter do agree much in their natures and Qualitys, they have
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59183:69"/> the ſame ſubject, the immortall Soul, which once was <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and Sins Eph.</hi> 2. 1.

It neither has ſuch high operations, nor ſuch high comforts, it is oft ſo ſecret and ſo hardly diſcernable either by the man, who enjoyes it, or by others, that Chriſt rather counts it a tendency to life, than life it ſelf, it is ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly below that life which ſhall be, in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, peace, Joy, and Glory the great perfections of this life, that it ſcarce deſerves to bear the ſame name, the life then, which we are here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59183:69"/> of, is the life of the Soul, after it is uncaſed of the body, this is the great life, whereunto the life of grace received in regeneration ſerves but as a way, this is that, which all Gods People find &amp; feel a want, yea a need of, which they all pant and breath after, it makes the Soul happy immediately after death, and the body too as well as the Soul ſoon after the reſurrection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> What is this way which leads to this life?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The way it ſelf is obedience and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal, complying with Gods will and denying our own. It is but going back the ſame way which man took, when he fell from this life, we had not been to ſeek for this life, if <hi>Adam</hi> had continued in the ſtate, wherein he was created, had he thus done, both he himſelf had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in holineſs and Righteouſneſs, and all his poſterity after him had probably been born in the ſame ſtate, but he being Tempted by Satan, cloſed with the Temptations, and inſtead of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with Gods will, gratified his own, and thereby ruined not only himſelf, but us too. Thus we are told, <hi>by one man Sin entred into the World &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 5. 12.</p>
            <p>A double death entred by <hi>Adams</hi> Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> A death of the Soul as to eternal life; this was the immediate reſult of his Sin, for by it he did as it were cut his own throat, and thereby utterly ſtript himſelf of Spiritual life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> A death of the body as to this Temporal life, this Followed upon his Sin alſo, yet not ſo
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59183:70"/> ſpeedily, for the ſeeds of death was only then ſown, which muſt have time to ripen. Now the way to get out of this death, into which we are plunged, and to attain again that life, which we have through Sin and folly loſt, is to take a quite contrary Courſe, and whatever Temptations we have to do with, either from the World or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, more to conſider what is Gods will, then our own, and rather to do, what God bids us, than what our own luſts incline us to.</p>
            <p>This is the way, the onely way, though Chriſt when inwardly received into the Soul as a new life, is the principle inclining and enabling us to Love, and chuſe, and keep this way; And Faith is the Inſtrument, whereby we Receive Chriſt as a principle of inward life and ſtrength.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. How do's this way lead to this life?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This obedience and ſelfdenyal has a tendency to advance us unto this life,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> Not as matter of merit, whereby we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve at Gods hands, that he ſhould advance us unto this life. The begger who comes to the door for alms, by coming do's not deſerve it, though without coming, he were never like to get it; That a Creature ſhould merit from God, from whom it has, and to whom it owes, all that it has and is, is both a proud opinion and a ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs one alſo; Eſpecially if we conſider in what a pittiful depraved condition man is, in whom this merit is ſuppoſed, and boaſted.</p>
            <p>For <hi>1ſt.</hi> Were we born with as great moral
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59183:70"/> perfections as Adam himſelf was created with, and did we improue theſe with the utmoſt care, diligence and Faithfulneſs unto the greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, ſo as at no time to omit any duty, or to commit any Sin, yet we ſhould by thus doing do no more, then we were bound to, for we owe our whole beings, and Lives, whatever we are, have and are able to do, unto that God from whom we received them, and by whom we are preſerved in them, And is there any ſo Fooliſh as to fancy, that there can be any great merit in paying of debts?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> As we are darkned in our minds and depraued in our hearts, we neither do nor can do half of that which we ought to do; we either fail in the matter, doing ſomthing which is unfitt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be done, or not doing ſomthing which is fitting to be done, or we fail in the manner, doing what we do, (when we do the beſt) with undue hearts, and for undue ends. So that we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes affronting and provoking God, either by our Sinful omiſſions or Commiſſions, either in the thing practiſed, or Neglected, or in the manner of our Practiſing or Neglecting it; And would it not be an unparalleld impudence in any to claime as due the leaſt reward for ſuch unworthy Carriages, how much l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſs ſo great a reward as eternal Life is?</p>

But</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> As a means whereby we are fitted for this life, ſuch a courſe is both preſcribed by God and has in it ſelf a natural tendency to bring us unto the life which we need and are concerned to ſeek after, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 50. 23. <hi>To him that ordereth his Converſation aright &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By ſetting our ſelves about this obedience and ſelfdenyall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> We come to underſtand really and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally how much we are without this life.</p>
            <p>For Obedience Would not be ſo diffcult a
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59183:71"/> Task had we that life unto which this is Naturall, we ſhould Love and delight in Obedience were this agreeable unto the frame of our Spirit, and were our wills as Conformable to Gods will, as they ſhould be, and would be, if we were not degenerate; There would be no more room for ſelfdenyal in us then there is for it in Heaven, among Angels and Saints, who find nothing in them to thwart Gods holy, Righteous, and good will. The firſt ſtep unto true life, is to be brought to a ſenſe that we are without it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> We come to underſtand the worth of this life. For we cannot but know that to obey God in his holy and Righteous preſcriptions is very much our duty; we owe this both to God, and to our ſelves, and to our Brethren, and we can never have quiet in our ſelves while our Conſciences teſtify againſt us that we walk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our duty, yet this we ſhall unavoidably do, ſo long as we want that life, which alone can make duty gratefull to us, while we force our ſelves to duty as a thing that we are tasked to, and which we may in no wiſe Neglect, unleſs we will run the hazard of beating for our ſloth, or while duty goes down with us againſt the ſtomack, we meddle with it as People do with Phiſick, which they abhor, yet take to prevent a greater miſchief; while we have no Love to duty, we are in Danger of a double trouble from it, Trouble in Diſcharging it contrary to our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, trouble in a total Neglecting of it, or a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59183:72"/> ſuperficial ſlubbering it over, when our conſcience takes occaſion hence to upbraid us with a want of fear of God, and care of our own Souls. Now thoſe who know how greivous it is ever to lie under one of theſe Troubles, cannot but count that life preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous which will totally free us from both, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly reconcile our Conſciences, Inclinations, and duties together, that there ſhall be no jarring among them. And when once we come to know the worth of this life, we are made to Prize, Love, Deſire, and ſeek it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> We Subdue, that which in its being, and workings, is moſt Contrary to this life. That which ties us faſt in Death is our owne luſts, theſe are the cords whereby Satan, and the World do keep us at a diſtance from God the Fountain of life, theſe like mud in the head of a ſpring, cauſe ſuch Obſtructions that a ſource of Living water, though it be Juſt at hand, cannot guſh out.</p>
            <p>Now obedience gives a check to theſe luſts, it hinders them from working while it finds the Soul a far different Imployment, it hinders them from thriving by diverting the ſap of the Soul ſome other wayes. While men Neglect Obedience and give the reins unto their luſts, they bring themſelves more under the power of their Luſts, and they have the leſs Command over themſelves, to refuſe doing what their luſts promp them to, neither can they ſo eaſily exert themſelves into their former liberty. But if we deny our luſts and diſcharge duty in ſpite
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59183:72"/> of them, we famiſh them, and thereby weaken them, that they cannot have that Rule in our Souls which formerly they had, and hereby the Soul is more eaſily to be reduced under the Command of Chriſt, and under, <hi>The law of the Spirit of life which is in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> We keep cloſe under the influences of the Quickening Spirit. All life is from God, and the nearer we are to God, the nearer we are to life. Now the diſtance we are in at any time from God, is not of place, but of ſtate. We cannot poſſibly be any where, where God is not preſent, for God <hi>Fills Heaven and Earth, Jer.</hi> 23. 24. But he is not preſent to us, we have no ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Experience of his preſence in us, becauſe our minds are averſe from him; The way then to find and feel the warmth of the Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is to turn to it, not by Changing our place, but by Changing the poſture of our Soul; our backs are towards God, while we follow our luſts; then we turn to God when we put our ſelves in the way of duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> As a condition upon which God has ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the giving of life. Eternal life being the gift of God, he may give it out unto whom he pleaſes, upon what termes he pleaſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. And that he has made Obedience the termes of Eternal life is euident; Chriſt tells the young man <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 17. <hi>If thou wilt enter into life keep the Commandments.</hi> Paul <hi>Saith God will render to every one according to their works, to them who by patien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The difference betwixt the Old and New Covenant do's not lie here, that the one requires works and the other do's not; But they both require works, onely with this difference, the Old Covenant requires good works from us to be done by our ſelves, the other requires good works in us to be done by the Spirit of Chriſt; And therefore by our Works we ſhall be tried at the great day whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be fit for life or we be not. As is evident <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe. 1ſt.</hi> Is there a way to life? then none are excluded by God from Eternal life, ſeeing God has not ſet this where it cannot be come at, but has left a way to it, which who ever take cannot miſs of Eternal life. There is a way to Eternal life, this way is declared what it is, and how it lies, we are loudly called by God into this way, Continually called by all providences, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, Now Therefore if we will not take this way, and for want of taking it ruine our ſelves, can we ſay that it is Gods fault that we come ſhort of life? Can we clear our ſelves either by pretending ignorance as if we knew not the way? <hi>when the Lord has ſhewed thee O man what is good And what do's the Lord by God require of thee &amp;c. Mic.</hi> 6. 8. Or by pleading Impotence we could not walk in it, this cannot be, for if it be a way
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59183:73"/> it muſt be paſſable; And though we cannot walk in this way of our ſelves, by our own ſtrength, yet by the help of God we may, and God is Never backward Seaſonably to give in Convenient help to thoſe who heartily deſire it of him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> Is there a way to life? let every one take heed how they come ſhort of life, had mans caſe been deſperate, and now that he has once fallen from life, there were no more poſſibility of his return to it again, then there is for the Devils, there being no way left to life for them, it would have been a troubling our ſelves to no purpoſe, ſhould we have ſtriven to get to life.</p>
            <p>What vſe could there be of any cares or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in ſuch a caſe?</p>
            <p>All would have been ſuperfluous. But now that there is a way to life, a way opened to us by the Blood of Chriſt, and we may attain to life if we do but for our ſelves what we might, and ought, we are greatly concerned to look to it, that we come not ſhort of life for all this, through our own unbelief, careleſneſs and ſloth. It is ſad to loſe life and to be vtterly and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly undone for want of it: But it will be far ſadder to loſe it, when it has been prepared and offered; a way has been made to it, and the way declared, and we called into it. Be the good never ſo Valuable that we come ſhort of, the Evil never ſo Intolerable, that we are plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into, yet if the one could not be by us
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59183:74"/> attained, the other could not be by us avoided, we Comfort our ſelves with this; that how greivous ſoever our Sufferings be, yet it could not be helped. But as the caſe is here, if we loſe life, and plung our ſelves into an endleſs Death, we ſhall be vtterly deprived even of this Comfort; we can never be able to ſay, that it could not be helped, there was no Remedy, it could never be otherwiſe then it is. No, then we ſhall be made to Remember, and to Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that it might have been far otherwiſe, we might have been as full of Happineſs, as we are now of Miſery, had we but taken the right way, and that we Miſſed the way, was not ſo much Ignorance, as Willfulneſs, or at the beſt Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs.</p>
            <p>This is that which will make Hell-fire burne hotter, and its pains Torment more intolerably, when we are made to Remember what Fair warnings we had againſt it, how we were told that the way we took was the ready Road to it, how we were ſeriouſly invited, and that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently into another way, which we were aſſured would lead us into a ſtate of as great Bleſſedneſs as we were capable of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. The Enterance into the way of life is through a Gate, a ſtrait Gate. If ye ask what Gate is this, it is the Gate of Regeneration, for this is the paſſage through which we turne out of the way of deſtruction, into the way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, while we are in our old nature, our motions
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59183:74"/> are Earth-ward, and Hell-ward, for that way do our Inclinations lead us; But when we have attained a new nature, a divine nature, our bent is altered, and by this we are carried Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and God-ward, our outward man is kept within bounds by the Law, and our inward man is Enlarged, and Raiſed, carried towards thoſe things which are Spiritual, and Eternal, by the Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> But what is Regeneration, which is the Gate into the way of life?</p>
            <p>It is ſuch an alteration wrought in the Soul by the powerfull operation of Gods Spirit, whereby the Soul which was Dead in Treſpaſſes and ſins <hi>Paſſes from Death to Life</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14. It comes to have new Senſes, new motions: It comes to have different apprehenſions from what it had before, Wealth, Honour, Pleaſures, it counted things of Worth and uſe, now it looks upon them but as vanity and vexation, the ways of Sin it looked upon as wayes of Credit, and Delight, now it can ſee nothing in them but ſorrow and ſhame.</p>
            <p>The Councells of God it did deſpiſe, as adviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to its prejudice, now it eſteems them as the moſt advantageous; The anger of God it ſlighted, as a thing which onely Melancholy Fools feared, now it cannot think of it without dread: Grace it looked upon as an Inglorious, uſeleſs thing, now it Eſteems it moſt Honourable, moſt Serviceable. It comes to have different affections
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59183:75"/> from what it had before, as its light is Chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo is its liking, it has new Objects for its Love, Deſire, Hope, Delight, for its Hatred, Fear, Anger, Greife. Other things, other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, other occaſions raiſe theſe from what did before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> But what makes Regeneration to be a ſtrait Gate?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer. 1ſt.</hi> It has difficulty in it which cannot be Maſtered by any power within us, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a power above us. No leſs power is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to raiſe us from the Death of ſin, to the life of Faith, then was exerted on Chriſt to raiſe him from the Dead, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1. 19. 20. In Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, we are raiſed aboue our ſelves, and we have not onely an impotency to it, but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy againſt it, we are ſo far from helping forward this work, that we oppoſe and hinder it, we cannot alter our own bent, and Motion; if this be done in us, it muſt be done by one without us, one above us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> It has trouble in it which we cannot beare up under, without much patience; here is the Cutting of the foreskin of the fleſh, which will not be without Wounds and Blood; the plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the fallow ground of the heart, which cannot be done without much rending and tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Bringing out a man Child unto God, which cannot be without the pangs of the new birth; Here is cutting of a Right Hand, plucking out a Right Eye, which can never be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

            <p>
               <hi>Vſe. 1ſt.</hi> For Examination; Let us hereby try our ſelves whether we be in the way to life or no, men generally preſume they are, and do not take it well at the Hands of any to Queſtion whether they be or no. To be ſure it is the Concernment of all to look to it that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be; But may we not be allowed to ask thoſe who conceit they are got into the way of life, how came they there? What Gate paſſed they in at to that way? Was it a wide Gate or a ſtrait one? We are told by Chriſt that the Gate which brings into the way of life is a ſtrait Gate, and ſure through ſuch a Gate we cannot get we do not know how. It is very ſuſpicious we are not yet in the way, if we know nothing at all of the ſtraitneſs of the Gate. If we have not found Difficulty and Trouble in Getting through it; Here it is that the Devil vtterly loſes his intereſt in us, if he let us now go we are gone for ever, and will he be contented quietly to part with his prey? <hi>Here the ſtrong man Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is Diſpoſſeſt of his Houſe, Luke.</hi> 11. 21 22. And can ye think he will come out of his poſſeſſions without Tearing? Can there be ſuch a great tug betwixt Gods Spirit, and Satan, whether ſhould have poſſeſſion of the Soul, and the Soul know nothing of this all the while?</p>

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59183:82"/> we are told before hand that the way of life is a Narrow way, a Rough way, if we found the way we were in to be Broad, and plain, we had then Reaſon to Suſpect that we had miſſed our way, for Chriſt did not ſo diſcribe the way of life to us. But when we find our way narrow and Rough, a way wherein we meet with many Sorrows, many Feares, much Wearineſs, we have reaſon to ſay with our ſelves, ſure this is the very way which Chriſt told us of.</p>

None who have travelled in that way did ever tell us that it was ſuch a ſoft, and eaſy way, but rather it is ſuch a way as the Jſraelites walked in, through the Wilderneſs, where they were Expoſed to many dangers from Serpents, Wild Beaſts, Enemies, where they were pinched with, many neceſſities, want of Drink, Meat for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and theirs, Exerciſed with many greiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, weary Travellings, Toilſome Fightings Tedious Diſtempers.</p>

No getting to life but this way, no loſing life while we keep in this way. Better be in this Narrow way to life, then in the Broad way to Deſtruction.</p>

            <p>It is <hi>Regeneration;</hi> for as ſoon as ever we come to be <hi>Born again,</hi> to have a new life put in us which naturally carries us Heaven ward, and makes us diſguſt vanity, and to be aſhamed of folly, and to loth all <hi>Impurity, Iniquity</hi> and <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy,</hi> then do's Chriſt dwell and Rule in us in ſome meaſure, he is in ſome ſenſe <hi>King</hi> over us, and we are made <hi>Kings with him.</hi> But as it is
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59183:90"/> in the World oft times after a King is Crown'd and own'd, he is hindred in the exerciſe of his regal Authority by the prevailing power of ſome Rebels, ſo that he is as it were King and no King, he has a Juſt Title to be King, but he cannot Exerciſe his Kingly Iuriſdiction untill he have ſubdued the Rebels, ſo it is after <hi>Regeneration,</hi> luſt gets up, and Chriſt withdraws as driven away, and till Chriſt return with power to ſubdue theſe luſts, there is little of the <hi>Kingdome of God</hi> appears, little <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> little <hi>Peace,</hi> nothing almoſt but Corruption and confuſion.

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59183:91"/> are very few that are out of the Kingdome, and out of the way to it, but they have great and fair hopes of it. It is the Devils policy to muzzle People in hopes of Heaven, when in the way they are in, they are never like to arrive there.</p>
            <p>But what gtounds have they for their hopes. Is God mercifull? Its true He is ſo; Infinitely Mercifull, but for all this mercy there are many Thouſands Roaring in Hell, and ſo maiſt thou come to be too. Are Chriſts merits vaſt? Indeed they are ſo, but for all that, there are Millions that are like to be never a whit the better for them.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that are not in the way to Heaven are certainly in the way to Hell, and ſure if they hold on in this courſe, as for any thing appears they are like to do, they have no reaſon to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that this ſhould ever bring them to Heaven; Nay, the higher and ſtronger their hop's are of getting to Heaven: the leſs ground there is for their hopes, for they are ſo much the likelier to hold on in the way they are in: and if it be not the way to Heaven, it will aſſuredly never bring them thither.</p>
            <p>Now can you be pleaſed that there ſhould be a Kingdome to be Enter'd into, and you neither in it, nor like to Enter it, nay to be at a greater diſtance from it while you hope for it, nay at a farther diſtance from it for your hopes.</p>
            <p>

            <p>2. Is there no danger of miſſing this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? What not when there are ſo many Thouſands that are very unlikely to come to it, ſo many Thouſands that are utterly in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity of ever attaining it?

            <p n="2">2. Are we affraid to come to Heaven over ſoon, will it be any inconvenience unto us to be raiſed above the vain Comforts of the Creature, and to be brought to full Satisfaction in God himſelf? Will it be any loſs to us to Exchange our luſts for Chriſt, and Earthly Comforts for Heavenly ones?

            <p>This is evident out of Chriſt words, for if every one who ſaid <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> did <hi>God's will</hi> they would certainly enter into Heaven: which yet Chriſt denyes they do. They may openly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that they are Chriſts Servants, and that he is their Lord; they may pretend that in many things they are willing ye deſirous to yeild him that obedience and Obſervance, which is due from a Servant to a Lord; they may have thoſe Expectations from him of Countenance, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, Maintenance, which a ſervant has from his Lord; they may make thoſe Ceremoniall addreſſes to him which a ſervant does to his Lord, in prayers and Religious duties, and yet live in Diſobedience to him.

            <p>The reaſon of this is taken from themſelves.</p>
            <p>Profeſſion is eaſy, but <hi>Sincere impartiall obedience</hi> is difficult, it cannot be done without denying themſelves in there Inclinations and intereſts, profeſſion neither puts to Toyle nor ſhame, nor Coſt to ſpeak of, neither do's it inwardly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet them, and therefore they can eaſily bear
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59183:93"/> an empty profeſſion, a form without power, they may be profeſſours without any great Trouble.</p>
            <p>But why muſt they be profeſſours, why may they not let the form of Religion alone as well as the power.</p>
            <p>Becauſe Profeſſion is convenient if not neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To quiet Conſcience, which will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent without ſomthing like Religion, as men give Children Counters inſtead of Gold to keep them from Crying.</p>
            <p n="2">2 To ſerve Temporal intereſt, for though the power of Religion be Troubleſome, as diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people in their ſinfull pleaſures, yet a form of Religion is very acceptable, and to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour after ſuch a mode as is moſt in requeſt brings much repute. So that this is a means oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to procure unto perſons Eſteem and love with ſome Perſons and parties, which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce much to the bringing them Cuſtome, if they be Tradeſmen, advantaging them in their marriages if they be ſingle perſons <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59183:97"/> Sands. if it fall with any Conſiderable violence, then an impetus is added to its weight, to make it beat more furiouſly. Here are Flouds towards the Foundation: whither by theſe we underſtand Flouds of the Sea, which when the Tide is up, eſpecially if it be a ſpring Tide, riſe high, Roar Horribly, and beat very Impetuouſly and may reach the Foundation of the houſe which is raiſed on the Sea-ſide; alſo when a Tempeſt is out by reaſon of which the Sea is put into a vehement Comotion, ſo that it cannot keep its Ordinary bounds, but overflows all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, at which time it ſtrikes with a mighty force, both through the Maſſineſs of its bulk, and alſo through the Impetuouſneſs of its motion; or we underſtand Flouds of the Land, when Rivers by reaſon of high Winds and great ſhowers of Rain, or Snow overflow their banks and beat down all before them; or when by Exceſſive Rains Turrents are made in thoſe low places where there uſe to be little or no water.</p>
            <p>Whither theſe Flouds come from the Sea, or Rivers, or the Clouds, they uſually move with that Violence, that it muſt be a very ſtrong Building that will be able to ſtand before them. Here are winds on all ſides upon the walls of the houſe; Now Experience ſhewes how great the force of theſe is, for the blowing down trees that are deeply and firmly rooted, the blowing down Buildings which ſeem to have great ſtrength and ſtability. Here is a concourſe of all
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59183:97"/> theſe weighty Tryalls at one and the ſame time; they all as it were meeting together to make proof of their vnited forces upon this new erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed houſe; or however at leaſt there is an Immediate ſucceſſion of each of theſe to other, the Rain inſinuating betwixt the Stones of the Building looſens them ſo that they may be eaſily ſeperated one from another, this is followed by the Flouds, one Floud upon the neck of another which do what may be done for the weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Foundation; then comes the winds fiercely Bluſtering upon the walls to bring all down together. It is not Floud and wind in the Singular Number, but Flouds and Winds in the Plurall, to ſhew that this houſe is not Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted only by one Floud, or one wind, but many.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> A good event, thoſe who are concerned any thing about the ſtanding of this houſe, when they ſee it aſſaulted on every ſide by ſo many furious adverſaries, which either ſet upon it altogether, or take their turnes for the demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, methinkes ſhould verily expect to ſee this made a Miſerable heap of Rubbiſh, or at leaſt greatly fear that it will ſcarce Eſcape this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall ſtate; how ſhould it, when, alaſs, what aſſaults it is too viſible, what ſhould ſupport and uphold it appears not at all. Yet beyond all hopes of friends, and Contrary to all Expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of Enemies, after that the Rain, the Flouds, the winds had bluſtered and beat there
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59183:98"/> utmoſt to ruine it, we find it ſtill ſtanding where it was before, unaltered, unremoved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> A ſolid ground for this; If any ask what reaſon can be given why this houſe ſhould ſtand though all that poſſibly could be done to ruine it has been done, when other houſes that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed full as firmly built, have fallen flat to the ground upon far leſs ſhaking. He may be eaſily anſwered, that whatever Foundation theſe Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inous houſes had, this had a ſteady and ſtable one, a Rock, which neither length of time could conſume, nor Violence of the Weather remove, and upon this account, this Continued ſtedfaſt while the other Totter'd and Tumbled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> Whoever erects a Spirituall building muſt expect to have the ſtrength of it tryed by many and Various Temptations.</p>
            <p>What Chriſt in the parable does declare to befall the Materiall Building when it was once raiſed: that we in the Morall ſhould expect to befall our Spirituall Buildings, we are no ſooner built upon the Foundation, being really united unto Chriſt, but forthwith we find ſtormes and Temptations on every ſide.</p>
            <p>Indeed while the Foundation is in laying, there is uſually great Tranquillity and ſerenity in the Soul. The Lord by his providence orders it ſo, that Temptations are held off on every ſide, there is no Diſturbance to the Soul either from luſts within, or from the world or Satan without, but there are Vigorous movings of the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59183:98"/> Soul after God, and gracious incom's of God into the Soul, in life and light, in peace and Joy, there is much ſtirring of grace, to put the Soul upon Action for God, much ſtirring of comfort to let the Soul find Satisfaction in God, much ſtirring of Light, to give the Soul to receive Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from God upon all Occaſions it is put to, and God herein does wiſely conſult the Souls reall and Eternall good. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> Hereby he confirms the union betwixt the Soul and Chriſt, which would never be ſo cloſe and intimate, and Conſequently ſo firme, if it met with any diſturbance at the firſt. If you Glew two bodies together, you muſt not move them untill the Glew be hardened, elſe they will not hold long together, if you would renew the union which has been diſſolved in any part of a Mans body either by wound or breach, you muſt not only compoſe them together in due order, but let them lye at reſt Cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for ſome time, if you ſtir them before they be well comented they fall aſunder forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and all your labour is loſt. God very well knows that ſhould he ſuffer a Soul which is Juſt now united to Chriſt to meet with any Diſturbance and hardſhip, there is great dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it ſhould be wrought off againe ſoon. A Member newly ſet in joynt, if it be put to any ſtreſs is ſoon disioynted again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> Hereby he does effectually wear the Soul from the Choyceſt comfort here below,

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59183:99"/> with them; untill the Soul be firmly united to the Foundation all ſtorms are allayed.</p>
            <p>But after the Foundation has been once laid well, and the Soul is unmoveably fixed on the Foundation; then follow a multiplicity and variety of Temptations, <hi>James</hi> was well aware of this method of God's when he warned thoſe he wrote to, what they were to Expect; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Exhorted them to receive theſe Numerous and Various Temptations rather with joy then greif, Conſidering the advantage which was like to accrue unto them by theſe, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 2. 3. 4. <hi>My brethren count it all Joy &amp;c.</hi> So was <hi>Peter</hi> too, when he forewarnes thoſe he wrote to, of a Tryall which they were to paſs through, which for its ſearching and Tormenting did well deſerve to be called <hi>Fiery:</hi> And though they, while they felt the greivouſneſs of it might conceit that none was ſo perplexed with Trouble as themſelves: Yet herein they would be in an errour, which being like to prove prejudiciall they had need to be cautioned againſt, 1. <hi>Peter.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Beloved think it not ſtrange Concerning the fiery Tryall</hi> &amp;c. It was no otherwiſe with them then it had been and would be with all their <hi>Brethren in the World,</hi> 1. <hi>Peter.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Knowing that the ſame Affictions are Accompliſhed in your Brethren &amp;c.</hi> When theſe Temptations do uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally beſet Perſons, the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> do's acquaint us, it is ſoon after they are <hi>Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,</hi> and the Foundation is laid in the Soul at
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59183:100"/> Converſion; for as it is in the firſt Creation ſo it is in the New Creation, light is the firſt thing which do's appear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 32. <hi>In which after ye were enlighted,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But why are theſe Temptations, which the Son ſoon after Converſion is ſet on by, reſembled to <hi>Showers, Flouds, Winds?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Becauſe they bear a certain analogy to theſe, and are that to the Spirituall houſe, which theſe are to the Materiall: Threatning as much to demoliſh this, as theſe do the other; for both ſet on the houſes, they beat on to bring down, with,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> A great potency of force. This is evident in Flouds which are the Commotions of the waters, as the wind is of the Aire, which being great bodies muſt needs have a ſtrength in them proportionable to their bulk: There are ſome Modern Philoſophers of late which Demonſtrate unto our very ſenſes, that the Aire though it ſeem a light body unto us, yet take a great quantity of it together in a full body, it has a very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable weight, and with its preſſure will make very heavy bodies to aſcend. And ſhowers though when they fall drop by drop, they ſeem to have ſmall force, yet when they come with full guſt, as is not unuſual in ſome Climates, they have power to ſink the ableſt Ships.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> A great Vehemency of Impetus. Lay an heavy ſtone upon a man it will preſs him ſore, yet if it be not very great it will do him no
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59183:100"/> further harm; but let the ſame Stone fall on him from any Conſiderable height, and it will cruſh him to pieces, and the higher it falls ſtill with more Vehemency it beats, and its force is more Effectuall, thus it is with Flouds, and winds, and ſhowers, which are great bodies put in Motion; which beſides their own proper and internall force, have an accidentall and externall Added from that impulſe which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: Like an arrow which if it lie on one, will ſcarce be felt: if it fall on one from ſome height will ſmite with a ſmart blow, and will do more then ſo, when it is ſhot out of a Strong Bow; for it will peirce a man quite through.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> A great Aſſiduity of preſſure. Uſually none of them come by ſits, have no intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but Continually urge the fall of the houſe till they have done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> A great Conſtancy of perſeverence. Theſe uſually keep on their bluſtering unto the very end, untill they be quite ſpent, and then they give over and reſt.</p>
            <p>Thus do Temptations with the Spirituall build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they come with force, they beat with Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, they give little Intermiſſion, they give not over till they have tryed their utmoſt ſtrength, as all Agents which are meer Naturall and not Rationall alſo do. I might add,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly.</hi> A great frequency of return. Though one ſhower, one Floud, one Wind be over, we are never ſecure but another may come.</p>
            <pb n="180" facs="tcp:59183:101"/>
            <p>But whence do the Temptations of Souls Ariſe?</p>
            <p>God has the generall Superintendency over all, he orders them both as to their kinds, and Meaſures, and Seaſons, and Durations; none ſhall come but what he ſends, or ſhall Afflict more then he pleaſes, or ſurprize at ſuch ſeaſons when God never intended it, nor Continue longer then agrees with God's will, and ſuits his deſigne; let whoever be the imediate inſtrument of them, men, or Devils, God is the Originall and Supreme Author.</p>
            <p>But then as to the particular cauſes of them, theſe are various, ſometimes God himſelf Tempts, for though God in ſome ſenſe <hi>Tempteth no man James,</hi> 1. 13. That is, none with a deſigne to draw to ſin, as Satan and mens luſts Tempt them, yet he Tempts many to try them, to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their graces to the World, and their Corruptions to themſelves, to purge them, to Exerciſe their graces <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the way of God's Tempting is partly by ſuſpending his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of light to direct, of life to quicken, of ſtrength to enable; partly by ordering his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences ſo, that the many luſts which are latent may have Occaſion to Act, and thereby diſcover themſelves; ſometimes Satan Tempts, as he Tempted Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. and <hi>Eve,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. and <hi>David,</hi> 1. Cron. 21. 1. <hi>To number the People.</hi> The falſe Prophet to delude <hi>Ahab</hi> with a lie 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 22. <hi>And he ſaid I will go forth
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59183:101"/> and I will be a lying Spirit in the Mouth of all his Prophets</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Job. To curſe God Job.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>Cha.</hi> 2. 5. 7. and <hi>Peter</hi> to deny his Maſter, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 31. <hi>Judas</hi> to betray his Maſter <hi>John</hi> 13. 2. and <hi>Ananias to lie to the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Acts 5. 3.</p>
            <p>Satan has ſeverall wayes to Tempt.</p>
            <p>1. By Inward ſuggeſtions. Though he cannot immediately inſinuate into the mind and heart, the underſtanding and will, (this being the ſole prerogative of God himſelf) as to have Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of the heart, ſo to have influence upon it directly, yet as he has ſeverall wayes of gueſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at what is ſtirring within a man, ſo he has Collaterall ways of influencing upon a man, for he can work much upon the fancy, and by the help of this, he can ſuggeſt both allurements to ſin, and Encouragements in it, and Directions how to manage it moſt perniciouſly: He can excite odd thoughts in the mind, by Reflections which he makes from the fancy; and he can Variouſly turn Affections, by putting different Motions upon the Blood and Spirits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> By outward Operation and apparitions. As thoſe who retired into the Wilderneſs in the primitive times to avoid the Violence of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, frequently Experienced Commotions of the Aire, the winds and Tempeſts as in <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe, he is <hi>the Prince of the Power of the Aire Ephe,</hi> 2. 2. Excitations of mens minds to do Gods People a Miſcheif, as he ſtirred up <hi>Judas</hi> againſt Chriſt. ſometimes men Tempt, freinds as well as
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59183:102"/> Enemies, good as well as bad; by their Example by their Counſels, and by their practiſes.</p>
            <p>But wherin do the Temptations of a Soul new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converted conſiſt.</p>
            <p>They conſiſt Cheifly in two things.</p>

               </gap> being greatly if not Totally ſuſpended.</p>
            <p>Now the Soul which has been lately ſo much weaned from the world, cannot but be in a very Diſconſolate condition, when it hangs as it were betwixt Heaven and Earth, lies betwixt God and the Creature, and can find Comfort in neither, like the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs, which can neither get backward unto the <hi>Garlick and Onyons</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> nor forwards unto the <hi>Milk and Honey of Canaan.</hi> So that here is want of inward Comfort unto the renewed Soul, that Comfort which it is uſed to in God, and which it has only
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59183:102"/> a Reliſh for, and then there is a ſenſe of what do's greive, as ſtirrings of Corruptions, omiſſions of dutyes, Commiſſions of ſins; it being left by God unto its own darkneſs and weakneſs, whereby Notwithſtanding its utmoſt Reſolution and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteſt Caution, it is overcome by Temptations; eaſily overcome by ſlight ones. Afterwards when the old nature gets more up, the Motions of the new Nature growing faint and low, and he who was Formerly Heavenly brings to be Earthly, and becomes ſomewhat taken with the Follies and Vanities which are in the World; he meets with abundance of Vexation in, and by them, Croſſes of ſtrong deſires, Fruſtratious of the faireſt hopes, various Occaſions of greif, and ſorrow by what befalls him in his Body, or Eſtate, or good name, or Relations.</p>

            <p>The ſtrength of this Building lies in the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Foundation, and the Cloſeneſs of the Souls union unto this Foundation. Now the Foundation it ſelf is ſuch as cannot be moved by all the Artifice and power either of the World, or Hell, or both.</p>
            <p>The main danger then of the Ruine of this Building lies in the looſneſs of its union to the Foundation; if this can be diſſolved the Building muſt needs fall. This union is made by an ardent love to Chriſt, and a Confident faith in Chriſt. If therefore a mans Affections to Chriſt can be any way alienated from him, if his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations from Chriſt can be utterly Diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his Building on Chriſt is like to fall.</p>
            <p>Here then is the Tryall which is made of the Building; if the Soul will ſtill perſiſt to love Chriſt, and that life, Righteouſneſs, Holineſs, and goodneſs, which is to be found in him, and got from him; ſo that it longs after theſe; Prizes theſe above all worldly Enjoyments what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, ſeeks for theſe in the uſe of all means, cannot be content to be without theſe upon any Termes, is reſolved not to loſe theſe, whatever they Coſt, when it finds for the preſent little but Trouble on every ſide, by making this Choyce, it neither finds Comfort in God, nor in the Creature; God forſakes and Friends forſake, every one is ready to deſpiſe and Reproach and perſecute us; profane Perſons becauſe we are for ſome Religion; and formall Perſons becauſe we
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59183:103"/> are not for theirs. We cannot reſt in any form be it what it will be, we find a need of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward life and power for our Satisfaction, and this we muſt have, let it coſt us our Eſtates, our liberties, our very lives.</p>
            <p>If thus the Soul has an unquenchable love to Chriſt, ſuch a love as is ſpoken of <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 6. 7. <hi>Which is as ſtrong as Death, and many Waters cannot quench it</hi> &amp;c. When nothing will move it to diſguſt Chriſt, though it ſuffer never ſo much by him and for him, nothing will allure it from Chriſt, though you preſent it with all the Pleaſures, Honours, Riches of the World.</p>
            <p>Here is an unparaled love to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>If the Soul will ſtill perſiſt to hope in Chriſt, when Chriſt ſeemes not only to Neglect but oppoſe it, when it gets nothing from him but frowns Rebukes and blowes, when all its En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours and Prayers ſeem in vain, and all Chriſts promiſſes and our Expectations fail, when luſts continue in their ſtrength, after all that we have done to pull them down; and grace conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues in its weakneſs, after all that we have done to raiſe it; its with the Soul as it is with the <hi>Church Iſa.</hi> 26. 18. <hi>We have been with Child, we have been in pain,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And Pſa.</hi> 74. 9. <hi>We ſee not our ſignes, there is no more any Prophet, neither is there among us any that knoweth how long,</hi> and yet ſtill the Soul will <hi>hold the begining of its Confidence ſtedfaſt to the end,</hi> Heb. 3. 14. <hi>It will hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59183:104"/> unto it, at the Revlation of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 1. <hi>Peter.</hi> 1. 13. It will not liſſen to the Miſgivings of its own heart, nor to the Diſcouragements it meets with from men, but will as <hi>David</hi> did in another caſe, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 6. <hi>Encourage its ſelf in the Lord its God, and when it walkes in darkneſs and hath no light, will truſt in the name of the Lord and ſtay upon its God, Iſa.</hi> 50. 10.</p>
            <p>But why do's God, who could eaſily prevent theſe Temptations, permit them? ſeeing he is Enclined by his nature, engaged by his love, Obliged by his promiſs to do his utmoſt for their good, whatever his wiſdome can Contrive, and his power Effect. Yea ſeeing he has In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed them in particular to beg this of him, that he would not <hi>lead them into Temptation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay why does he lay a Foundation for theſe Tryalls, and make way for them, by removing thoſe inward Comforts of his Spirit, which while the Soul enjoyes it has little ſenſe of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Afflictions whatſoever, be they never ſo grievous; it was the ſenſe of theſe which made the fire to be as inoffenſive, as delightfull, as a bed of Roſes to the Tryvmphing Martyr's, it has little reliſh for all other delights, little Ambition for any other glories, it can eaſily deſpiſe them, as it do's diſguſt them, having theſe to ſatiſfie it ſelf with: No Adverſity can weary it, no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity can inveagle it, ſo that it ſhall be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to quit Chriſt, to break its Union to him, its Communion with him.</p>
            <pb n="187" facs="tcp:59183:104"/>
            <p>As to the latter, why God do's deſert it after the Foundation is ſurely laid. It is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> That by withdrawing his powerfull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, corruptions might recover ſtrength, and Act, and by Acting diſcover themſelves to the Soul. For it is impoſible a man ſhould believe himſelf to be ſo Exceedingly polluted as he will find himſelf, when he veiws himſelf in the light of God, and is in a great meaſure deprived of Reſtraining grace.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, may not the Remembrance of his Former Enormities, before he was ſavingly wrought upon by God, ſufficiently convince him.</p>
            <p>No, partly becauſe he did not much obſerve theſe, as making no great Conſcience of his ways, and not obliging himſelf greatly to keep a Conſtant watch over his heart, that he might take Notice where the maſs of Corruption lies. Partly becauſe then he had very ſmall light to diſcern any but groſs Corruptions: Whereas the moſt abominable and Miſcheivous luſts are more refined and ſpirituall, and ſo ſcape the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of his dull eye, partly becauſe he has forgotten the more particular Aggravations of his ſinfull courſes: Partly becauſe ſince his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion there are new Aggravations which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the ſinfulneſs of his wayes, what he do's, being done againſt light, and ſtrength, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, and promiſes, wherewith he has obliged himſelf; and mercies wherewith God has Obliged him.</p>
            <pb n="188" facs="tcp:59183:105"/>
            <p>When God do's overflow a man with his grace, ſo that he eaſily keeps at under his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and finds little diſturbance by them in the way of duty, he is ready to conceit himſelf to be far more pure then God knowes him to be, and then he'le find himſelf to be; and its Impoſſible to beat him out of this proud conceit, but by giving him to find it confuted by reall Experience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> That he by Trying his own ſtrength, may be feelingly convinced of the weakneſs of it, for at the Firſt whatever God helps him to do, he is ready vainly to fancy that he can do that well enough of himſelf; and ſo whatever is well done by him, he imputes it to himſelf; Like the Child when his father or Maſter has guided his hand to write, will bragg of his fair Writing. One who is full of grace Aſſiſting him, is ready to preſume he <hi>Can do all things;</hi> but when he comes to know himſelf aright, and to underſtand that the grace which helped him was none of his own, but God's, and ſuch as God does Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily Communicate, and may withdraw at his Pleaſure, he modeſtly adds <hi>through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me Phil.</hi> 4. 13. Otherwiſe he finds <hi>he is not Sufficient of himſelf to think any thing as of himſelf,</hi> 2, <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. He cannot reſtrain his Corruptions, he cannot reſiſt his Temptations, he cannot diſcharge his duty, he cannot bear his Croſs, he cannot Improve his advantage. It is from hence that thoſe Perſons who have much
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59183:105"/> of God in them have far worſe conceits of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, then the Vileſt ſinners have; not that they are really worſe, but becauſe they ſee more of their own badneſs, they have a light ſet up in them to ſee by, and by this Deſertion they have an advantage whereby feelingly to Diſtinguiſh betwixt Chriſt in them, and ſelf, betwixt the good which is in them by grace, and the Evill which is in them by nature; to men altogether Unexperienced of this Condition, What St. <hi>Paul</hi> Avouches is a very Paradox, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18. <hi>For I know that in me, (that it in my fleſh,) dwelleth no good thing</hi> &amp;c. So then this do's very much conduce, nay is abſolutely Neceſſary to work men into thoſe ſelf abaſings which the Humility of the Goſpell prompts to, they could never ſee what ſinfull Creatures, what Fooliſh and weak Creatures they are otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>God orders thoſe outward Affliction which his People meet with from men and Devils.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> That they may find the Workings of thoſe Corruptions, which the man would never have ſuſpected himſelf enclined to, had he not been brought into an Afflicted Condition wherein there is Temptations to them.</p>
            <p>As a man would not know that there is any thing of Impatience, or unbelief, in him, was he alwayes in proſperity, for who cannot truſt God when he ſees him, or who will not take every thing well at Gods hands, when God pleaſes him in every thing.</p>
            <pb n="190" facs="tcp:59183:106"/>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> That the Corruptions which are ſtirring in them, whereby they are Vehemently and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuouſly carried out after the Vanity of the World, may Receive an Effectuall check; when men have every thing according to their will, and meet with no Troubles, they are very apt to be proud, and to deſpiſe thoſe who are in an Afflicted Condition, they are apt to be worldly, and to pleaſe themſelves with the pomp of the World, and the Friendſhip of the World, they are apt to be ſenſuall and to wallow in brutiſh pleaſures, they are apt to Neglect God, finding no great need of him, and to concern themſelves little about the intereſt of their Souls, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the poverty and danger they are in. It is only Affliction, which when grace is low keeps Corruptions at under, and reſtrains the Soul from running out into thoſe Extravagancies which otherwiſe it is over prone to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> That the Soul may be kept in its motion Heavenwards. Becauſe grace is very low, the Soul is not carried ſo much after the things which are aboue as it once was, and it ſtill ſhould be, and therefore it had need to have a Spur to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en it in its Motion, and the Temptations it meets with ſerve to this uſe. For when it can meet with nothing but Vexation every where on this ſide Chriſt, it's Neceſſitated for its own eaſe to ſeek for Reſt in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But why do's the Devil Tempt thoſe whom he is not like to hurt by his Temptations, but rather to Advantage?</p>
            <pb n="191" facs="tcp:59183:106"/>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> A Tryall of a new Erected build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is ſet on grievouſly and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, by Showers at the Top, Flouds at the Foundation, and Winds at the ſides and Walls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> A reſult of this Tryall, <hi>It fell not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> A reaſon of this reſult, <hi>for it was Founded on a Rock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Tryall I have already ſpoken to, the reſult of this is, that the houſe when all was done, fell not, though enough was done to make the faireſt and ſtrongeſt houſe (which wanted a good Foundation) fall; &amp; though thoſe, who were deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſee the fall of it, were never ſo high in their hopes of obtaining this deſire, yet the houſe ſtood where it did at the firſt, as firm as ever.</p>
            <p>Now what is the reaſon why this houſe ſhould ſtand, when many houſes that, ſo far as any man
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59183:108"/> could diſcern, were full as ſtrongly built, have come down to the ground, and been laid all on heaps by far leſs ſearching and preſſing Tryalls then theſe? The reaſon is, that the houſes, which fell, wanted the ſtrength and ſupport, which this ſtanding houſe has; they were not founded on a <hi>Rock</hi> as this is: What was above ground in the Superſtructure, was full as fair and promiſing to Mans eyes: but what was under ground in the Foundation, was deceitfull.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> Whatever Temptations a ſpirituall Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is Founded on a Rock meets with, let them do their worſt againſt it, it will keep from falling.</p>
            <p>Any houſe will ſtand while the Weather is Fair and Favourable, and nothing done againſt it to try its ſtrength; but only that houſe which has a good Foundation, and which is well built upon this Foundation, will abide all ſtormes.</p>
            <p>There are Two things Obſervable in this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of Chriſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> He ſuppoſes the worſt done that can be done, for the weak'ning and Overturning of this houſe: he grants, that it may be Aſſaulted on every ſide by many and Conſiderable Enemies, which uſe their utmoſt ſtrength and force againſt it. Nay, he ſhews that it will be thus Aſſaulted, Showers, and Flouds, and Winds, will come and Furiouſly beat on it, if not all together, yet one ſo in the Neck of another, that they ſhall do what may be done, for the Ruin of it.</p>
            <pb n="195" facs="tcp:59183:108"/>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> When he ſay's that the houſe fell not, after all this done to bring it down; He aſſerts it <hi>Peremptorily,</hi> he ſaith not, it did not fall ſoon, or it did not fall eaſily, but it did not fall at all. He aſſerts it <hi>Vniverſally,</hi> he ſaith not, that ſome houſe, that was built by a wiſe man on a Rock, fell not: But what ever houſe it be, that is built wiſely, ſo as to be <hi>Founded on a Rock,</hi> let it be aſſaulted by never ſuch violent ſtormes, it ſtands in ſpite of them. He Aſſerts it <hi>Experimentally,</hi> as a thing which he has not only heard, but known.</p>
            <p>In proſecuting this propoſition I ſhall ſhew,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt. In what ſenſe we own this for a truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly. How it may be proved to be one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly. What grounds there are for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly. How weak the Exceptions are that are, made againſt it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we ſay ſuch a Building falls not,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> We do not ſay, that a Building, which ſeems founded on a Rock, falls not, but that which is really ſo Founded; for it muſt be granted, that Hypocrites may Caſt a very fair ſhew, ſo as not only to deceive others, but themſelves too, as doubtleſs thoſe did, who to the very laſt preſumed, that they were ſo intereſted in Chriſt, that they needed never fear to be diſowned by him at the great day, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>Many will ſay to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not Propheſied in thy Name</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now the fall of ſuch is no Exception to this
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59183:109"/> Truth, for it do's not follow, that becauſe Meteors in the Heavens, which ſeem to be Stars, but are only Jellies, which have got a great height and thereby much imbibe the Suns light, are ſeen Frequently to fall, that therefore the Stars of Heaven do fall too. Men may ſo Speciouſly profeſs Chriſt, as, though they be no living Branches in Chriſt, yet to gain the repute of being ſo. Now if theſe be taken away from the Root, it follows not, that the true living Branches can be taken away alſo. St. <hi>John,</hi> 15. 2. <hi>Every Branch in me that beareth not Fruit, he taketh away</hi> &amp;c. If thoſe, who have only <hi>a name to live,</hi> but are Really Dead, as it was with the <hi>Angel of the Church of Sardis Rev.</hi> 3. 1. do afterwards carry ſo, as to make it apparent to all, that they are Dead indeed; this hinders not but thoſe who are indeed alive, may ſtill keep their life and cannot loſe it. If thoſe, who are ſo near the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God,</hi> that they ſeem in it, eſpecially to thoſe, who are little Judicious in ſuch matters, (it was eaſy for Ordinary Perſons to miſtake him to be in the <hi>Kingdome of God,</hi> whom Chriſt Judges not to be far off <hi>Mark.</hi> 12. 34.) If theſe I ſay remove to a greater diſtance from God's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, than once they we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> at, to ſo great a diſtance that every one may now ſee, they are not in it, this ſhews not that thoſe who are once in the Kingdome of God may come out again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> We ſay not, that a Building, which is really <hi>Founded on a Rock,</hi> may not ſeem to fall. We
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59183:109"/> grant, that one Really Vnited unto Chriſt may ſeem to fall off from him, he may ſeem thus both to himſelf, and to others. And this is not Unuſuall unto thoſe, who are in the ſtate of Deſertion; on whom little Fruit can be diſcerned by others outwardly, in whom little Fruit is found by themſelves inwardly. All that they know by themſelves is this; that they are not as they have been, as they ſhould be, as they would be, and this is all, that is ſtirring in them near the Root, which Evidences them to be alive, like the Tree whoſe leaves are all gone. <hi>Eſai.</hi> 6. 13. Thus the Tree in Winter ſeems dead, for it has no more on it, than a dead Tree has, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fruit, nor ſo much as Leaves. Yet it is not dead, for at the Spring it ſhew's, it has life in it, which it could not have, if ever it had loſt it quite. Thus a man in a Swoon ſeems to be quite dead, he neither has ſenſe, nor Motion, nor Pulſe, nor Breath, nor Colour; He is every way as like a dead Corps as can be for a while, yet that he is not dead appears Sufficiently, in that he Recovers again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> Neither do I ſay, that thoſe, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Founded on a Rock, may not really fall in part, and for a while, as an houſe may ſtand, and yet have ſomething blown off it, or waſhed from it. As ſome Slate, or Tile off the Roof, ſome Plaiſter off the Walls <hi>&amp;c.</hi> One really Vnited to Chriſt, and Quicken'd in him, and by him, may loſe much of the Vigour of his life, much of the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59183:110"/> ſtrength of his life, much of the Fruits of his life. The inward motions of his Soul after God, and the things of God, ſuch as Holineſs, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, goodneſs, may be leſs Vehement, leſs Frequent, the outward Expreſſions of gracious motions within, whether in words, or Carriages, or Actions, may be leſs conſpicuous. And this may be either through Gods Arbitrary withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Soul to try it, and humble it, and Empty it; Or through the Souls Voluntary withdrawing from God; for though he who is <hi>Born of God,</hi> ſo far as he is <hi>Born of God,</hi> cannot ſin, yet as he is Born of meer Man, and carries about him his Old nature, he may, eſpecially when he is expoſed to Violent Temptations. And by Sinning he may provoke God to ſuſpend his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, and may incapacitate himſelf to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Influences, which God is willing and ready to give in.</p>
            <p>That then which is to be Aſſerted is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> That one Built upon the Rock Chriſt, can neither fall <hi>Totally,</hi> nor <hi>Finally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By a Totall fall I mean, ſuch a fall as would, be incurr'd by the Chriſtian, ſhould he be ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be removed off the Foundation, and to loſe his Union to Chriſt. The Conſequence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, muſt Neceſſarily be the loſs of all ſaving grace; ſo that though he ſtill retained ſome gifts and Common graces, which might render him <hi>Tolerable</hi> in the World, yea <hi>Serviceable,</hi> yet he was wholly without ſaving grace: which might
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59183:110"/> make his heart good, bent for God and holineſs.</p>
            <p>Now thus fall he cannot, though he may commit ſome ſins, yea and groſs ſins; and alſo Neglect ſome Conſiderable duties, and come under the Tyranny of ſome luſt, which he was Unacquainted with before, and little Exerciſe ſuch graces as formerly were ſtirring in him, yet ſtill he can never be ſo, but he'le have the Root of grace in him, and ſtill the bent of his heart will be Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, though as to any actuall motions of his Soul that way, he be either diverted from them by ſome <hi>Deceit,</hi> or hindr'd in them by ſome <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi> Thus the ſtone has an Inclination towards the center though it move, not that way, ſo long as ſome hand interpoſes to ſtop its motion. The Fountain has a ſtrong tendency to ſend our ſtreams of freſh water, though ſo long as the ſpring is ſtopt with ſtones, or mud, no water at all appears.</p>
            <p>A Chriſtian then may fall partially but he cannot fall Totally.</p>
            <p>By a Finall fall I Underſtand ſuch a fall as he will never recover out of, nor ſhake off the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of.</p>
            <p>Now a partiall fall may be ſuppoſed, where thereis no Totall. As there may be a finall death, where there is no Totall. As when a Man dies as to one part, be it a leg or an Arm, which is ſo Seized on by the Palſey, as to loſe all ſenſe and Motion, which he never recovers again; in this caſe he dies finally, as to one part, though he die
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59183:111"/> not Totally as to his whole body.</p>
            <p>Now this we ſay of one, who is Built on the Rock Chriſt, and is a Chriſtian. As he can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fall <hi>Totally,</hi> ſo as to loſe his whole new life, Root and Branch; ſo neither can he fall <hi>Finally,</hi> ſo as never to recover that Meaſure of Life and Grace, which he is ſuppoſed to loſe. Indeed he may lie ſome while in his fall, without Riſing again by Repentance, as it was with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who after he had denyed Chriſt once, went on to deny him again, and again more Grievouſly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in this ſin without Repentance for about three houres, (as Divines by comparing together ſeverall Circumſtances of the Hiſtory, do compute) from Nine, till about Midnight, though he was Admoniſhed of his ſin, by the <hi>Cock Crowing Twice,</hi> for we find <hi>Luke.</hi> 22. 61. That St. <hi>Peter</hi> did not Remember what Chriſt had told him about his <hi>Denying him Thrice, before the Cock Crew Twice, till Chriſt looked upon him;</hi> and much more in <hi>David,</hi> who after he had defiled <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> and Murdered <hi>Uriah,</hi> Continued in his ſin about a Year not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, for he Repented not till <hi>Nathan</hi> reproved him, and <hi>Nathan</hi> reproved him not, till a Child was born of his adultery with <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 14. But God will order it ſo, that by ſome <hi>Ordinance,</hi> or ſome <hi>Providence</hi> he ſhall be Excited, and Enabled, to recover himſelf again, either dureing his Life time, or however at his Death; he ſhall recover himſelf ſo, as to be able and ready to forſake every ſin he has lived in, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59183:111"/> every duty he has Neglected, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come every luſt he has been kept under by, to Exerciſe every grace he has been deficient in.</p>
            <p>But how do's it appear, that thoſe, who are Built on Chriſt, neither do, nor can fall, either Totally or Finally?</p>
            <p>I ſhall not go about to Evidence either of theſe diſtinctly, but ſhall handle them conjointly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> That life and grace, which Chriſtians Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive upon their Union to Chriſt as their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, head and Root, are reſembled to ſuch things as abide, if they do not grow and Flouriſh. <hi>It is like a well of Water,</hi> which uſually is not dryed up, though the Summer be very droughty, <hi>John.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>A well of water, Springing up into Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life.</hi> It is like a <hi>Tree Planted by the waters,</hi> which lives, and grows, and Flouriſhes, when others are quite dead for want of Rain. <hi>Jere.</hi> 17. 8 It is like <hi>Seed,</hi> which has <hi>Taken Root in good Ground</hi> and therefore abides, and Thrives, <hi>and brings forth Fruit,</hi> St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 23. St. <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 15.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay all theſe things have their end, few Fountaines but in time they quite fail: No Trees, how Commodiouſly ſoever planted, but in time die: No ſeed, but when it has brought forth as much fruit as it will, dies it ſelf, and its Fruit will in time decay.</p>
            <p>Yet let it be Conſidered that all theſe, laſt full as long as it could be Expected, they ſhould do, according to their nature, and if they laſt not always, it is becauſe their Nature is but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for a time.</p>
            <pb n="202" facs="tcp:59183:112"/>
            <p>Now its the nature of ſaving grace to continue for ever, for <hi>it is Everlaſting life</hi> as it is called, St. <hi>Jobn.</hi> 3. 36. <hi>He that beleives on the Son hath Everlaſting life.</hi> 1. John. 5. 11. <hi>God hath given to us Eternal life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> Thoſe who are thus united unto Chriſt are ſuch as <hi>God has Choſen to Salvation,</hi> and therefore they cannot fall away <hi>Totally</hi> &amp; <hi>Finally;</hi> if they could, they would miſs of that Salvation which they are choſen to, and ſo Gods Election would be Fruſtrated.</p>
            <p>Whoever are united to Chriſt are choſen of God, is evident, becauſe all thoſe are Effectually called, (Vnion to Chriſt being the Immediate reſult of Effectuall Vocation) and none are thus called by God, but ſuch as he has Choſen, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. Whoever are choſen of God are choſen to Salvation, is as Evident, for this is the End, which God deſignes to advance to, when he culls out ſuch from the World, as he Judges fit for his purpoſe 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>God has from the begining choſen you to Salvation</hi> &amp;c. That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever fall away from grace muſt Aſſuredly miſs of Salvation, is evident to all, who underſtand and Conſider.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> What thoſe, who are ſaved, are mainly ſaved from, and this is their luſts and Sins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>He ſhall ſave his People from their ſins,</hi> and this they cannot be, if they fall away from Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> What they are mainly ſaved to, or for,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59183:112"/> and that is Glory. Now thoſe, who have loſt grace, are incapable of glory, grace differing not at all from glory but in degres, grace is but glory in its Infancy, and glory is but grace in its full Growth.</p>
            <p>Now that thoſe, who are Elected by God unto Salvation, cannot miſs of it, is Evident, whether we conſider Scripture or Reaſon. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, its not poſſible for the Elect to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> Into ſuch Errours or ſins wherby they may miſs Salvation, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 24. <hi>In ſo much that if it were poſſible, they ſhall deceive the very Elect.</hi> Whoever are <hi>Blinded,</hi> ſo as to miſs Salvation, the <hi>Election Obtains it. i. e,</hi> Thoſe who are Elected by Vertue of their Election <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 7. And reaſon ſhewes, that whoever are Choſen by God unto Salvation muſt certainly attain it, unleſs God want either <hi>Power,</hi> Effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually to purſue his purpoſe till he have brought it about, or <hi>will,</hi> to do what he is able, neither of which can be ſuppoſed, granting but that which none can with any ſhew of reaſon deny, that God is Omnipotent on the one hand, and all Wiſe on the other.</p>
            <p>If he be Almighty, he can Effect whatever he has a mind to bring about; and if he be all Wiſe, he can never alter from what he purpoſes.</p>
            <p>The only reaſon why men change and give over purſuing what once they intended, when ſtill it is in their power ſo to purſue it as to attain it, is becauſe they are now of another
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59183:113"/> mind then once they were, and that becauſe they find Inconveniencies now, which formerly they never thought of; but this is their Fooliſhneſs, which is not to be ſuppoſed in the all wiſe God, who perfectly diſcernes whatever might be like to induce him to wave his Choice before he makes it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> Thoſe who are thus united unto Chriſt, are ſuch as are Aprehended by Chriſt for ſome end, and will not be let go by Chriſt till that end be attained. As St. <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>Apprehended by Chriſt,</hi> ſo are all that are in Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12. As our firſt Vnion unto Chriſt, Chriſt takes hold of us by the hand of his Spirit, and we take hold of him by the hand of our faith.</p>
            <p>Now that which Chriſt takes hold of us for, is to bring us unto that, which a Chriſtian by his Inclination is Carried out to reach after; <hi>I follow after, that I may Apprehend that, for which alſo I am Apprehended</hi> &amp;c. Now there is no attaining this, which is Holineſs, and Righteouſneſs, in their Perfection, with the peace, Joy and Glory, which is the Neceſſary reſult of theſe, without holding faſt grace, and holding on in good works, in Obedience, patience, and Self-denyall.</p>
            <p>Now they being in Chriſts hand, to be brought unto this end, unleſs Chriſt want either power to keep them in his hand, or power while he do's keep them in his hand, to bring them unto that Salvation he deſignes them for, how can thoſe miſs Eternall Life, of whom Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I give unto them Eternall Life, John,</hi> 10. 28. <hi>Who
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59183:113"/> are kept by the power of God through Faith unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. They are come unto Chriſt, got into his hand, and ſuch Chriſt will not <hi>Caſt out, John.</hi> 6. 36. It is his Fathers will, he ſhould <hi>Loſe none of them, Ver.</hi> 39.

            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> Thoſe who are thus united unto Chriſt, are ſuch as have a Love to God and Chriſt, and Chriſt has a Love to them; now ſuch no Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations can Separate, it is Chriſts Love to them, that makes him Joyn himſelf to them, it is their love to Chriſt which makes them Cloſe with him. Now theſe Chriſt will always love, for his love is an <hi>Everlaſting Love, Jere.</hi> 31. 3. <hi>Whom he loves he loves to the End. John.</hi> 13. 1. And this love of Chriſt Engages his Wiſdome, and Power for their Protection, and no Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations be they never ſo great are able to prevail againſt theſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 35. 39. <hi>God will not Suffer them to be Tempted above what they are able</hi> &amp;c. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. Theſe, by God's help ſhall never overcome them ſo far, as to make them willing to leave Chriſt, and Chriſt will not leave them, though they ſhould be willing to leave him, much leſs when they are not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly.</hi> They are Sealed by the Spirit unto Salvat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>Who hath alſo Sealed us. Ye are Sealed with the holy Spirit of promiſs which is the Earneſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Greive not the holy Spirit of God.</hi> God by giving them his Spirit, do's that to them which
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:59183:114"/> men do by ſetting to their Seals, or by giving Earneſt, they do confirm the bargain, and make ſure the performance of it; So that hereby God's truth and faithfulneſs is engaged to make good the Salvation which he by the Seal and earneſt, has Obliged himſelf unto; which he cannot do without keeping them from Totall and finall Apoſtaſy 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 24. <hi>Faithfull is he who has called you,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 8. 9. <hi>Who ſhall confirm you unto the End</hi> &amp;c. <hi>God is faithfull by whom ye were called.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>6ly.</hi> Uniting a Soul unto Chriſt as to its Foundation is Gods work, which he begins with a deſign to Compleat, for this is an Imperfect work in its ſelf; the laying of a Foundation is good to nothing unleſs their follow a Building on the Foundation, and a perfecting the Building you ſhall not meet with any man who is in his Wits, that lets his work reſt Immediately after he has laid the Foundation, unleſs he be diverted by more urgent Buſineſs, or hindred by downright Violence, as the <hi>Jewes</hi> were in the Building of the Temple.</p>
            <p>Now this being God's work he'le perfect as well as begin it, <hi>For all God's works are perfect Deut.</hi> 32. 4. He leaves them not half done. This made St. <hi>Paul</hi> Confident of the <hi>Philippians</hi> doing well, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6. God had begun and he could not Believe but he would go on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7ly.</hi> For all ſuch as are Vnited to Chriſt, Chriſt did pray on Earth, and ſtill Intercedes
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59183:114"/> in Heaven. What he prayed for <hi>Peter,</hi> he preſſes God for all, that their <hi>Faith may not fail,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Satan be let out to Tempt them, <hi>Luke.</hi> 22. 32. He prays that God would <hi>Keep them from Evil. John.</hi> 17. 5. And this he begs not only for his Diſciples that then attended him. <hi>But for all that ſhould Beleive on him through their words Verſe.</hi> 2. Therefore it cannot be pretended that this prayer was made for ſome few and not for all Chriſts Members. Now if the <hi>Prayer of a Righteous Man</hi> be ſo <hi>Effectuall Jam.</hi> 5. 6. Shall we think that the prayer of Chriſt, who is the Holy one of God, the Son of God, that it ſhall prevail <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> nothing? may Chriſtians be Confident <hi>That if they ask any thing According to God's will he hears them,</hi> 1, <hi>Joh,</hi> 5. 14. And may they not be as Confident that if Chriſt aske any thing he ſhall not be denyed? he himſelf was ſo, <hi>John</hi> 11. 41. 42. <hi>I know that thou heareſt me always.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> upon this account was very Confident that none could riſe up againſt him to Condemn him, or otherwiſe hurt him, becauſe Chriſt <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceded</hi> for him, among others <hi>Rom,</hi> 8. 34.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>8ly.</hi> This is the great thing which thoſe who are Vnited to Chriſt do moſt Prize, Love, and deſire, ſeek, and pray for, that they may be <hi>Eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abliſhed</hi> in what is good, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>Peter</hi> begged no more for the diſperſed <hi>Jewes,</hi> then every Sincere Chriſtian begs for himſelf, that they may be kept from the <hi>Evil of Temptations. Mat,</hi> 6. 13, Chriſt Teaches them thus to pray by his
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59183:115"/> Spirit that they may be made <hi>To go in the Paths of his Commandments Pſal.</hi> 119. 35. <hi>Make me to go</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Incline mine heart</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Turn away mine Eyes</hi> &amp;c. Now ſhall not he <hi>Who fulfills the Deſire of ſuch as fear him, Pſal.</hi> 145. 19. Anſwer them in theſe which are ſo every way agreeable to his will? When they deſire to be kept Cloſe to God, and God deſires it too; Shall the Devil, or the World, or the Fleſh be able to hinder it? When God bids them <hi>Ask, Seek, Knock,</hi> and Encourages them to this, by telling them they ſhall <hi>Receive, Find,</hi> and get <hi>Opened, Mat.</hi> 7. 7. And when they follow his Counſell, and obey his Commands and take heart by his Encouragements, will he diſapoint them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>9ly.</hi> God is Engaged by Covenant to keep them from falling, and therefore he is Engaged to do his utmoſt Towards this, and he is able to do what he has Engaged to do, <hi>Jude.</hi> 24. <hi>Now unto him who is able to keep you from Falling</hi> &amp;c. This is the Tenure of the New Covenant which God has Entered into with every one who is Really Vnited to Chriſt, to <hi>Put his Law in their Inward parts and Write it in their hearts</hi> &amp;c. Jere. 31. 33. <hi>That he'le neither depart from them nor they from him,</hi> Jere. 32. 39. 40. <hi>They ſhall fear him for ever</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That he'le cauſe them to walk in his Statutes and Keep his Judgments and do them,</hi> Ezek, 36. 27. <hi>That he'le betroth them to himſelf for ever</hi> &amp;c. Hoſe, 2. 19. 20. <hi>That the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſhould ſooner depart, and the Hills be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved</hi>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:59183:115"/> &amp;c. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54. 9. 10. That <hi>his Spirit ſhall not depart from them, nor their Seed, Iſai.</hi> 59. 11. Indeed theſe promiſes ſeem to be made unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the Fleſh, but they were deſigned for <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the Spirit; the <hi>Jewes</hi> Literall are but a Type of the <hi>Jewes</hi> Myſticall, and the promiſes, which were made to them in the Letter, according to their more Spirituall and high meaning belong to the True <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God. And we have the very ſame things promiſed in the New Teſtament, though in other Terms, that God will Build his Church ſo on a Rock that <hi>Hells Gates,</hi> with all the power and policy of Hell, <hi>cannot prevail againſt it. Mat.</hi> 16. 18. And that the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which God gives his People, <hi>ſhall abide with them for ever; John.</hi> 14. 16. Its true alſo, that theſe promiſes are not ſenſibly made good to his People of a long while, yet even then they are Really made good, though not ſo fully as they ſhall be; they cleave to God, when their hearts ſeem to wander from him, they fear God, when their <hi>Hearts</hi> ſeem moſt <hi>hardened from his Fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>10ly.</hi> In thoſe, who are truly United unto Chriſt, Sin is ſo Mortified as never to recover Life again, and the Soul is ſo Quicken'd as never to die again, no more than Chriſt died after he once roſe; Thoſe who are Really United unto Chriſt, are Baptized into his Death, ſo as they begin to die unto Sin, and though Sin do's no die forthwith in them, no more than Chriſt dies immediately after he was Nailed on the Croſs
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59183:116"/> yet they continue dying by degrees, as Chriſt did, untill they be quite dead, and they are <hi>Baptized into his Reſurrection,</hi> ſo as to be Raiſed to a new Life which ſhall no more die than Chriſt did, after he was once Raiſed. And this is the importance of <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3. 11. <hi>Know ye not that ſo many of us, as were Baptized into Jeſus Chriſt, were Baptized into his Death? Likewiſe reckon your ſelves Dead unto Sin, but alive to God.</hi> And thoſe whom it is thus with, can never fall either <hi>Totally</hi> or <hi>Finally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>11ly.</hi> Thoſe who thus fall, evidence that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſeemed, they never really were United unto Chriſt, for if they had been, they would have kept to him. It will appear, <hi>that we are Chriſts houſe, if we hold on to the end,</hi> Heb. 3. 6. <hi>We are partakers of Chriſt, if we hold to the End, V.</hi> 14.

               </gap> there, why thoſe who are thus Built on Chriſt, cannot fall neither <hi>Totally</hi> nor <hi>Finally?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer Firſt, becauſe the Foundation it ſelf cannot fail, it being the <hi>Rock of Ages Pſa:</hi> 26. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the ſame Yeſterday, and to day, and for
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59183:116"/> ever.</hi> Heb. 13, 8. He is <hi>a ſure Foundation.</hi> Iſa. 28. 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> The union between the Soul and Chriſt the Foundation cannot be diſſolved. On Chriſts part it cannot, becauſe he is altogether Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable: On the Souls part it cannot, becauſe Tho' it be mutable in it ſelf, yet it is Eſtabliſhed in Chriſt. There is a double Reaſon of its Eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> From the <hi>Nature of that Life,</hi> which Springs up in it from the Foundation of Life, Chriſt, unto whom it is United. This continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſpringing up keeps the will, which otherwiſe would be fickle enough, ſteadily bent for God the ſame way Heaven-wards; hence it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

For there is no Sin, but what is Voluntary, now their will is already Engaged for God: They may do, what ought not to be done, through Ignorance or weakneſs, being overpowered by Temptations, Tranſported by Luſts and Paſſions, but their Will cannot fully conſent to Sin, becauſe it is otherwiſe preingaged. Thus a Weather-Cock is very mutable of it ſelf, but if there be a Wind, that Blows on it continually, that keeps continually in the ſome Quarter, the Weather-Cock it ſelfe will keep Immoveable; thus a Cork or ſome ſuch light thing is eaſily moveable this way or that way, but if it be caſt into a ſtream, which continually moves the ſame way, it is determined to a certain motion.</p>

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:59183:118"/> but <hi>Common Grace,</hi> which is only the <hi>Workings</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> upon a man, may be loſt. And it is a Diſadvantage to loſe it (Tho' of it ſelf it is not Sufficient to Salvation) both becauſe thoſe, who have common grace are nearer to Salvation than thoſe, who have it not, and alſo becauſe, if they ſhould miſs of Salvation, they are how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever even by Common Grace reſtrained from many ſins, which otherwiſe they would run into, and thereby Aggravate their own Guilt and increaſe there miſery.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59183:118"/> Warineſs. That which is the great ſecurity of Gods People in their grace is, that one part of their Grace is a fear of God, and a Jealouſy of themſelves, and that which does Excite this fear, and awaken this Jealouſy in them is the being cautioned of their danger. This makes them <hi>Work out their Salvation with fear and Trembling, Phil.</hi> 2. 12. Though the nurſe have ſuch hold of the Child, as to keep it from falling, yet to make it more cautious in its walking, ſhe may Fright it by minding it of the danger it is in of falling, if it be left to it ſelf, and this fear of fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be one means to keep it on its Legs.</p>

            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> Thoſe know well that what mainly ſecures them againſt this great danger of falling away, is that Principle of fear, which God has Implanted in them, and that it is the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of this, which is the means to preſerve them.</p>

None can expect to gain by preſuming to ſin, becauſe they are ſo joyned to <hi>Chriſt</hi> as they cannot be ſeparated from him; God will follow them with ſuch <hi>Inward Terrours,</hi> and outward pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſures, as will weary them out of all theſe ſinfull Courſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe. 1ſt.</hi> This ſhews the Excellent ſtate, to which <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (ſuch as are ſo indeed) are arrived. They have got <hi>Grace,</hi> which is the moſt precious thing in the World, for it is the ſeed of <hi>Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are got into Gods favour, that favour, which is the Originall of all Bleſſings what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever both of Soul and body: They are <hi>Sons of Gods, Brethren of Chriſt, Temples of the Holy-Ghoſt, Heirs of Heaven, Objects of Gods Love and care, the Charge of his Provideace.</hi> And what makes all theſe advantages com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat is, that they are ſo firmly ſtated in them, that they can never wholly loſe them; whereas all worldly Enjoyments and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments are Expoſed to variety of hazards, even the firmeſt and ſureſt of them. What reaſon then have thoſe, who are advanced thus high, to give thanks to their <hi>Good God</hi> for
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59183:119"/> what he has already done for them and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intends them? What need they care, though they want many of the Conveniences of the world which others have, when they have that, which is Incomparably of Greater worth, which the Generality of the <hi>World</hi> are without?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> Take heed of taking up with ſuch Attainments in <hi>Grace,</hi> as may be loſt again; That which may be loſt, can never Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly Advantage us; we are not Rooted and Grounded in it. <hi>We are not born again of Corruptible Seed, but of Incorruptible, by the Word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. Indeed <hi>Common Grace</hi> is better than no <hi>Grace,</hi> as it is a ſtep nearer <hi>Saving Grace,</hi> and as it Reſtrains from ſuch Extravagances as would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our Miſery in <hi>Hell,</hi> but it is not to be Reſted in, how Specious ſoever it be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it cannot aſſure us of <hi>Heaven,</hi> nor ſecure us from <hi>Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhould therefore be much in Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our ſelves, whether that <hi>Grace,</hi> which we pleaſe our ſelves in, have <hi>a Root</hi> and <hi>a Spring</hi> within us; if not, it will not laſt long, it will never abide the <hi>Tryals,</hi> it ſhall ſhall meet with in Life and Death. If it be not <hi>a New Nature</hi> in us, altering the very bent and Inclinations of our hearts,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59183:120"/> it will never continue. If the <hi>Living Word</hi> be not ingrafted in us, it will never ſtay long with us.</p>
            <p>Whoever they be that think, that <hi>Saving Grace</hi> may be ſo eaſily loſt, it is much to be doubted, whether ever they knew the <hi>Power</hi> of it, what a great <hi>Alteration</hi> it works in the Soul.</p>

            <p>Sometimes <hi>God</hi> ſuffers them to Fall during this <hi>Life.</hi> Thus it was with <hi>Judas,</hi> who betrayed his <hi>Maſter,</hi> withdrew himſelf from the <hi>Society</hi> of the <hi>Diſciples,</hi> loſt all the <hi>Reputation</hi> he had got by being an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> was greatly diſquieted in his own <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and Killed himſelf; after he had done much, ſuffered ſomething, gained ſome <hi>Repute</hi> among Good men, and probably had ſome meaſure of <hi>Peace</hi> in his <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and ſome hope of <hi>Happineſs</hi> after <hi>Death.</hi> Thus it was with <hi>Hymeneus, Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> who though they had <hi>profeſſed the Faith,</hi> and <hi>uſed a Good Conſcience</hi> in many things, and got ſome <hi>Name</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> yet afterwards <hi>fell off</hi> from all. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19. 20. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 17. 18.

Sometimes they are made to ſee all this, while they are in a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> to declare it to the <hi>World,</hi> and all about them ſee, that they die Miſerably, full of horrour and deſpair: Sometimes they ſee this, before they be quite <hi>Dead,</hi> but they are ſo far gone, that they cannot expreſs the <hi>Anguiſh</hi> they feel. Thoſe ghaſtly looks, and thoſe frightfull Shrinks, which are to be diſcerned
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:59183:138"/> in ſome dying Perſons, it is very probable, are not ſo much the reſult of Vehement <hi>Pains</hi> of <hi>Body,</hi> as of extream <hi>Anguiſh</hi> on their <hi>Spirit,</hi> when they are made indeed to ſee, whither they are going. Sometimes their <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> continues untill the very laſt breath, and their <hi>Amazement</hi> muſt needs be very <hi>Horrible,</hi> when they feel themſelves in <hi>Hell,</hi> before ever they thought of it.</p>
            <p>It is certain, all theſe <hi>Advantages</hi> muſt come to nothing at <hi>Death.</hi> For</p>

            <p>The <hi>Fall</hi> is Great in it ſelf. It is <hi>Totall,</hi> whatever men have Raiſed to themſelves by their <hi>Religion,</hi> all comes down together.

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:59183:142"/> of men, that are without God: unleſs we can imagine that there are ſome without God, that need him not, but can be well enough without him, although the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> repreſenteth this as the height of the <hi>Miſery</hi> of an <hi>Unregenerate Perſon,</hi> that he is <hi>without God in the World. Ephes.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
            <p>The Foregoing Propoſition implieth</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> That men in their <hi>Naturall Condition,</hi> are ſo <hi>without God,</hi> as not to find him without <hi>ſeeking.</hi> They are at a Remote diſtance from God, not as to <hi>Place,</hi> that being utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, (for he who fills <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> with his <hi>Immenſe Eſſence,</hi> cannot but be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately preſent with every <hi>Soul</hi>) but as to <hi>State.</hi> For the Bent of their Hearts being directly contrary to the <hi>Divine nature</hi> and Will, they are no more capable of admitting the gracious <hi>Influences</hi> of God, than a Lump of Clay can take in the Light of the Sun, tho' it ſhine never ſo bright round about it. But this is not all the Wretchedneſs of an <hi>Unreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enerate Condition,</hi> for men in that <hi>Eſtate</hi> are not only without <hi>God,</hi> who is the only Originall of their Life and Comforts, the only Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of their Hopes, but are alſo <hi>Ignorant</hi> where to find him: If they underſtood but how to go Directly to <hi>God,</hi> they would not need long to ſeek him. And this is one of the Bittereſt Fruits of the Originall Apoſtacy of our firſt Parents, which has been continued
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:59183:142"/> and increaſed by our Actuall Tranſgreſſions. It is the Root of all thoſe Extreme Miſchiefs, which follow Sin, either as Naturall Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it, or Penall Chaſtiſements for it: Whatever we at any time complain of, may be juſtly Imputed to this. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 2. <hi>Your Iniquities of have Separated between you and your God, and your ſins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> That men, while without God, and thus at a diſtance from him, do greatly and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſtand in need of God, and can in no wiſe be without him. Were it not for this, we ſhould hear of no Commands iſſued out from God, for the enjoyning men to ſeek him. For the good and wiſe God, although his <hi>Supremacy</hi> be unqueſtionable, yet he Loves not to Act Arbitrarily, merely for the Oſtent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of his <hi>Power,</hi> but he is induced to Act by the Conſideration of ſome Holy, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and good End, which he would Promote. Now this End cannot refer to himſelf, for the infinite, ever Bleſſed, all ſufficient God, the <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> is utterly uncapable of any Addition to himſelf: It muſt therefore be the Conveniences and Neceſſities of poor Sinfull man, that God conſults in the giving out of his Commands. When God therefore ſayes to man <hi>Seek me;</hi> we may aſſure our ſelves, that we have need ſo to do, God knows we have need. Poſſibly Fooliſh man
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:59183:143"/> may have other Conceits in his head, while with Children he pleaſes himſelf in Toyes; but when once with the <hi>Prodigal</hi> he comes to himſelf, being awakened out of his pleaſing Dream, by a ſight of Sin, fear of Gods wrath, and the Law's curſe; by a ſenſe of Judgements, Eſpecially ſuch as Afflict the Body, or affright with black Apprehenſions of <hi>Death,</hi> or deprive of thoſe Lower Comforts, which are moſt ſet by, then he clearly deſcerns and ſenſibly Experiences the <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Vexation</hi> of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is beſides and below God, and thereby Learns, that the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> he ſo much needs, is no where to be expected, but in God only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> That men, notwithſtanding the need they ſtand in of God, are very backward to ſeek him. Men will not be induced to ſeek God by the faireſt <hi>Invitations,</hi> and the moſt earneſt <hi>Entreaties,</hi> they muſt be in a manner compelled to ſeek God by ſtrict <hi>Commands</hi> and ſevere <hi>Threatnings.</hi> God would ſpare thoſe, did he not ſee, that there would be no ſeeking him without them; nay, Experience ſhews, that all theſe will ſcarce do, for men ſeldome ſeek God in good earneſt, till the Inceſſant <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of God do as it were drive them out of their Sins, their Earthly Comforts and themſelves unto God. This is one great piece of the Miſery of an <hi>Apoſtate State,</hi> that men are ſenſeleſs of it, and ſo do not concern themſelves to ſeek unto him, who only can
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:59183:143"/> ſave from it; like men in <hi>High Feavers,</hi> who greatly need the Help of a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> yet being in raging <hi>Phrenſies,</hi> they as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe and reject it, as being altogether unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of their own Danger. Men are generally ſo averſe from ſeeking God, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> obſerves out of <hi>Scripture,</hi> that there <hi>are none that ſeek after God,</hi> and he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes it to this, that <hi>they underſtand not. Rom.</hi> 3. 11. Alaſs! they know not their <hi>Want</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> they feel not their need of God, they underſtand not the <hi>Worth</hi> of God; they have ſeverall things to make <hi>Gods</hi> of to themſelves to pleaſe themſelves in. The <hi>God of this World</hi> blinds them, that they ſee not their <hi>Godleſs Condition,</hi> he hardens them, that they feel it not, and holds them, that they ſtir not out of it. <hi>The Luſts of the Fleſh &amp; the World</hi> find them ſeverall other things to ſeek beſides God, whom they moſt need.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> That God may be Found, if duly and Timely fought. While one obſerves what Groſs neglect there is of God in the <hi>World,</hi> how few ſeek him, and that men are for the moſt part wholly intent upon the Purſuit of other things, he has <hi>Temptations</hi> to conceit, that ſurely <hi>God</hi> is not at all to be found, otherwiſe men would not be ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately mad, as never to concern themſelves about ſeeking him, ſeing without him they cannot but be <hi>Utterly</hi> and <hi>Everlaſtingly undone</hi>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:59183:144"/> without <hi>Remedy.</hi> But this ſtrange Careleſſneſs of God is rather the Reſult of their <hi>Senſeleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the need they ſtand in of God, than of their <hi>Deſpair</hi> of finding him. For the <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

When the <hi>Soul</hi> is once ſeparated from this <hi>Lumpiſh Body,</hi> which ſtraitens its Capacities and dulls its ſenſes, and greatly unfits it for Converſe with any thing but this Groſs world: then it comes immediately to have to do with God himſelf, whom it has ſo much deſpiſed and hated; and his <hi>preſence</hi> they can in no wiſe poſſibly avoid, although by reaſon of the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:59183:145"/> 
               <hi>Contrariety,</hi> which is between <hi>Gods nature</hi> and theirs, it be extremely Tormenting to them, like a fire that doth continually ſcorch. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 14. <hi>Who among us ſhall dwell with Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Burnings?</hi>

After Death the ſtate of the Soul is unalterable; it is with men then, as it was with the <hi>Devils</hi> immediately after their Fall, their Wills are Immutably fixed to their former Choice, ſo that thoſe who will not ſeek God now, cannot then; There is no ſuch <hi>Work</hi> as <hi>ſeeking in the Grave, whither we go.</hi> Beſides, if there could be any ſeeking God after death, there could be no finding him then, ſeing there is then a <hi>Vaſt Gulf fixt between God and Sinfull Souls.</hi> S. <hi>Luke.</hi> 16. 26. The <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> who ſuppoſe a <hi>Purgatory</hi> after death, and a ſeeking and finding God out of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> only aſſign this <hi>Purgatory</hi> for thoſe in the <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> who have been ſincerely ſeeking God during this Life, but have not found him, being not ſufficiently purified, and ſo not prepared for him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> It may poſſibly be ended during Life. There are thoſe, who have outlived the day of <hi>Grace,</hi> in which God offers himſelf to be found.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:59183:145"/> Thus it was with <hi>Pharoah,</hi> whom God after the ſixth Plague reſerved alive, till he ſhould have a more ſeaſonable opportunity for the Glorifying of himſelf in his deſtruction. Thus it was alſo with <hi>Judas,</hi> of whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave this Character ſome time before his death, that he was a <hi>Devil.</hi> S. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 70.

And this is only ſo long as there is any Hopes, that a Sinner may be Reclaimed by any <hi>Methods</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> which Gods Wiſdome and Juſtice will allow to be uſed towards him. But if after a Tryall of all theſe, in ſpight of Inſtructions and Reproofs, of mercy and Judgement, of what God can do mediately by his <hi>Miniſters</hi> and of what God thinks fit to do immediately by his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> the Sinner perſiſt obſtinately and Incorrigibly in neglecting and rejecting of God, God ſaith of him, as he ſaid of <hi>Ephraim

After this there can be no ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God ſo as to find him, let a man live never ſo long.</p>
            <p>Having ſhewn you thoſe things, that were implied in the firſt <hi>Propoſition,</hi> I come now to the <hi>Propoſition</hi> it ſelf, and ſhall ſhew you, <hi>That it is the Duty and Concern of all to ſeek God, ſo as to find him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is their <hi>Duty,</hi> for</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> It is the <hi>Precept</hi> of God, whom we ought to obey, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 4. <hi>Seek ye the Lord and his ſtrength: Seek his face evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It is the <hi>Practiſe</hi> of the <hi>Saints,</hi> whom we ought to imitate. <hi>This is the Generation of them, that ſeek him Pſal.</hi> 24. 6. It need not be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, whom God ſpeaks to <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51. 1. <hi>Ye that ſeek the Lord,</hi> for it is to them, that <hi>follow after Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Promiſes</hi> of God encourage to it, and they ought not to be ſlighted: The <hi>Promiſe</hi> aſſures of us, that we <hi>Shall find God, if we ſearch for him with all our heart. Jer.</hi> 26. 13. And together with him every good thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 10. <hi>They that ſeek the Lord, ſhall not want any good thing.</hi>

            <p>4. The <hi>Providences</hi> of God call to this, and they ought to be complied with. <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> are therefore vouchſafed to men to this purpoſe. God hath ſet men <hi>The bounds of their habitations, that they ſhould ſeek the Lord. Act.</hi> 17. 46. 27.

And ſo in a manner baffle him by their perverſeneſs in a moſt gracious deſign.</p>
            <p>5. This is the deſign of <hi>Chriſts</hi> undertakings, wherein he ſhould not be Fruſtrated. <hi>Chriſt</hi> became <hi>EMMANUEL, God with us,</hi> that God might be in us: He aſſumed the Humane nature, that we might be Partakers of the Divine, which cannot be without our finding God. <hi>He ſuffered for ſins that he might bring us unto God.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet:</hi> 3. 18. The Bloud of Chriſt was for making <hi>thoſe that were a far off, nigh unto God. Ephe.</hi> 2. 13. Which cannot be without ſeeking him.</p>
            <p>It is their <hi>Concern</hi> alſo, for</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> If men find God, in him they will find two great <hi>Advantages,</hi> which they will but in vain ſeek for any where elſe. Theſe are,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt. Salvation</hi> from evil things, as luſt, ſin with all the Miſchevous Conſequences of it, Gods wrath, the Laws Curſe, the Miſeries of this life, the Terrours of Death, and the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:59183:147"/> Torments of <hi>Hell.</hi> From evil Perſons, Enemies without, as wicked men and cruel Devils, the great enemy within, our Carnall ſelves. In all theſe caſes it is palpably evident, that <hi>Salvation belongeth unto the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly. Satisfaction</hi> in God. The <hi>Soul</hi> was made for God at the firſt, and only God can fit it and fill it, anſwering its vaſt Capacities, and fulfilling its numerous deſires: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is beſides and below God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all worldly Enjoyments are unſuitable to a <hi>Soul,</hi> which is Spirituall; unproportionable to a <hi>Soul,</hi> which is immenſe &amp; Eternall Without God himſelf there cannot be that <hi>peace of God, which paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all underſtanding, Phil.</hi> 4. 7. There will not be that <hi>Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory,</hi> that <hi>Fullneſs of Joy,</hi> which only is in <hi>Gods preſence. Pſal.</hi> 16 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> If men finally miſs of <hi>finding God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> They ſuſtain great loſs, their Souls will be loſt, the moſt noble and durable part of man, the immediate workmanſhip of Gods hands, the purchaſe of Chriſts Bloud, which is of more value then many worlds, will be utterly and Irrecoverably loſt. Not that it will ceaſe to be, but it will be ſo miſerable, that it had better never have been: It will be an extream Burden to its ſelf, being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God; for it can never poſſibly enjoy it ſelf, if it find not God.</p>

What! have we found God already? It is well, if we have. But let me tell you there are not many, that have found him, neither is he ſoon and eaſily found: and Men have no reaſon to preſume, that they have found <hi>God,</hi> unleſs they have uncontroulable <hi>Evidences,</hi> that they have found him.

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:59183:148"/> If happineſs, everlaſting happineſs be worth ſeeking, God is; for only by finding <hi>God,</hi> we are like to find that.</p>

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:59183:149"/> neceſſary <hi>work,</hi> is it likely it ſhould be more inclinable to <hi>ſeek God,</hi> when longer <hi>Cuſtome</hi> in ſin has further perverted it, worldly <hi>Affaires</hi> have more Entangled it, fleſhly <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi> have more inveagled it, <hi>Satans Cunning</hi> and <hi>power</hi> has more inſlaved it? How if thou neither wanteſt <hi>will,</hi> nor any of the forementioned Requiſites for <hi>ſeeking God,</hi> and yet want <hi>power</hi> to do it to purpoſe?

You ſee then ſuch a <hi>Reſolution</hi> of putting off the <hi>ſeeking of God</hi> for a while is very unſafe.</p>
            <p>It is alſo very unmeet, and inconvenient: If thou wert never ſo ſure, that thou couldeſt afterwards <hi>ſeek God</hi> ſo as to find him, yet by delaying to do ſo now, thou art like to be a <hi>loſer;</hi> for the longer thou putteſt off <hi>ſeeking God,</hi> the later thou wilt find him, and ſo in the mean time thou wilt be deprived of all thoſe gifts, graces, and Comforts, wherewith <hi>God</hi> once found, would have enriched, adorned, and refreſhed thee.</p>
            <p>Moreover it is to be feared, that ſuch a <hi>Reſolution</hi> is unſound, how plauſible ſo ever
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:59183:150"/> it ſeems. Men often pretend, they will ſeek <hi>God,</hi> when they intend nothing leſs, but only uſe this <hi>pretence</hi> as a ſpecious <hi>Excuſe</hi> for their not <hi>ſeeking God</hi> for the preſent, thereby to ſtop the <hi>Clamour</hi> of their own <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which, ſo long as it is <hi>awake,</hi> will be very frequently and ſharply reproving them for their groſs <hi>Negligence</hi> in a buſineſs of ſo great importance.</p>
            <p>Thou, who ſayeſt, thou wilt ſeek God hereafter, if thou doſt not ſay this meerly out of <hi>Form,</hi> but haſt a real deſign to perform it, and doſt verily believe, that <hi>God</hi> is worth <hi>finding,</hi> why doſt thou not forthwith ſet about this <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>ſeeking</hi> him? For thou haſt now the ſame <hi>Motives</hi> and <hi>Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to excite thee to ſeek him, and the ſame or rather greater <hi>Opportunities, Helps</hi> and <hi>Aſſiſtances</hi> of <hi>Gods Spirit,</hi> than thou canſt ever expect to have at any <hi>Future Time</hi> which thou canſt propoſe to thy ſelf. For the longer thou continueſt in a <hi>Sinfull Courſe,</hi> the more thou wilt <hi>grieve the Holy Spirit,</hi> and the more thou wilt be hardened in <hi>Sin,</hi> and ſo make thy <hi>Finding</hi> of <hi>God</hi> the more difficult.</p>
